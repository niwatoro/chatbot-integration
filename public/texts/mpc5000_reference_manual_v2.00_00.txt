Sincerely, The MPC5000 Team  
Overview 
In this chapter, we’ll go over the basics of the MPC5000 including the name and function of each button, slider, knob, 
and jack.  Next, we’ll also cover how to hook up your MPC5000 to the rest of your studio.  Finally, we’ll review the basic MPC-related concepts and terminology th at is found throughout this manual. 
Note that in this manual, the names of buttons, knobs, sliders, and input/output jacks are found in brackets and in all 
caps as follows: [NAME].  Names of different operating mo des are displayed in all capitals, such as PROGRAM mode. 
Fields and parameters on the screen will be indica ted by single quotes, su ch as 'copy sequence'. 
 Top Panel  
Most of the MPC5000’s controls are located on the top of the unit.  These controls are as follows: 
 
  
 
1.  [MAIN VOLUME] Knob:  
This knob controls the loudness level of the [PHONES] and [STEREO OUT] jacks on the rear of the MPC5000.  Use this 
knob to control the volume of your headphones or speakers. 
2. [REC GAIN] Knob:  
This knob controls the gain level of the [INPUT] and [PHONO] jacks on the rear of the MPC.  Use this knob to set proper 
input levels before you begin recording your own samples. 
3. [INPUT SELECT] Switch:  
This switch sets the source for your MPC5000’s [INPUT THRU ] and record functions.  Set this switch to the 'PHONO' 
position, for sampling from the RCA jacks,  (CD player, DJ mixer, Minidisk, etc.) and to the 'MIC' position for recording 
from the [RECORD IN] MIC/1/4" combo jacks. 2 1 3 
4 


Introduction 2 
4. [INPUT THRU] Button:  
Using this button, you can mix the input signal from the [RECORD IN] jacks to the [STEREO OUT] jacks.  This way, an 
additional source can be monitored through the MPC5000's outp uts without the need for a mixing board.  You can also 
use the MPC5000’s internal effects on this signal. The level of the input signal is controlled by the [REC GAIN] knob.  For more information, see the 'Inp ut Thru” section at page 92. 
5. [PAD BANK] Buttons:  
These buttons let you switch be tween pad banks A, B, C, and D, allowing you to have 64 total pads.  The currently 
active bank will be illuminated. 
 
6. [FULL LEVEL] Button:  
When this button is engaged, the MPC's pads always play back at their maximum volume.  Pads will be recorded at 
Maximum MIDI velocity (127).  When the button is diseng aged, the pads can be played using their entire dynamic 
range,   with the pads getting quieter as you hit softer.  Pads will be recorded using the entire MIDI range of velocity (0 -127). 
7. [16 LEVEL] Button:  
This button allows you to use all 16 drum pads to play one sample with increasing velocity, increased filter effect, or 
play a single sample at  16 different pitches. 
In other words, if 16 LEVEL is set to Velocity, all of the pads play one sample but the velocity of that sample increases as you move from [PAD 1] to [PAD 16].  See page 79 for more about this feature. 
8. [TRACK MUTE] Button:  
This button calls up the TRACK MUTE page where you can mute or solo your sequence’s individual tracks using the pads, or mute individual pads in the current program.  For more on Track mutes, see page  80. For more information on 
Pad mutes, see page 82. 
9. [NEXT SEQ] Button:  
This button calls up the NEXT SEQ page, where you can switch sequences by pressing a pad.  For more information, see 
the 'Selecting a Sequence to Play with Pads' section on page 84. 
 
10. NUMERIC KEYPAD  
These buttons are used to enter numeric data directly.  Enter numbers with these buttons into selected numeric fields and press the [ENTER] button.  If you are entering numbers with a decimal value, enter the number ignoring the decimal point.  (Example: for 120.5, enter 1205.).  If you make a mistake, it is possible to cancel by pressing the [SHIFT] button.  If you use the [CURSOR] buttons, [DATA] wheel, or [MAIN] button while you are entering data with the numeric buttons, the input will be canceled and the data returns to its original value. 10 6 7 8 9

Also, you will notice that much like a telephone, each numbe r also has three or four letters associated with it.  These 
are used for naming programs, tracks, samples etc.  For more information on naming, see page 20.   These buttons can 
also be used in SAMPLE lists, FX lists, and in DISK Mode to quickly jump to the first item corresponding to the letter pressed. 
11. [DATA] Wheel / [+ ] and [-] Buttons:  
This wheel lets you change the value of the currently selected field.  Turning the wheel clockwise increases values, or moves you forward in a list, whereas turning the wheel counterclockwise decreases values or moves you backwards in a list. 
Also, the [+] and [-] buttons can be used to change the selected value by single increments.  These are best used for 
fine adjustments. 
12. [CURSOR] Buttons:  
These four buttons let you move your cursor around the LCD screen to select the various parameters available on screen.  Holding [SHIFT] while in a list and pressing up or down will bring you to the top or bottom of the list, 
respectively.   While in [MAIN] mode, pressing [SHIFT] + [UP] will always select the 'Sequence' field, and [SHIFT] + [DOWN] will alwa ys select the 'Track' field.  
13. [TAP TEMPO] Button:  
You can set a sequence’s tempo by tappin g this button at the desired rate.  Fo r more about setting tempos, see 'The 
Sequencer' on page 21. 
 
 
14. [MAIN] Button:  
This is the Main page of the MPC5000 and is displayed when th e unit is powered on.  Pressing the [MAIN] button at any 
time will return you to this pa ge.  See 'Operating Modes' on page 16 for more about this button. 
15. [MODE] Button:  
The MPC5000 has several different operating modes and each mode is assigned to its own pad.  To shift between these 
modes, press the [MODE] button and then  hit the pad corresponding to the mode you wish to enter.  See page 16 for 
more on this. 
16. [SHIFT] Button:  
Many of the MPC5000’s buttons and pads serve more than one function.  Holding the [SHIFT] button while pressing 
these buttons and pads allows you to access the secondary functions. 
17. [UNDO] Button:  
If you are unsatisfied with your last performance, you can quic kly delete the last take by pressing the [UNDO].  You are 
also able to undo certain sample editing func tions, like Reverse, Discard and Normalize.

Introduction 4 
 
18. [STEP] Buttons ('<' And '>'):  
These buttons will step you through a sequence according to  the value of the timing correct setting.  See 'STEP EDIT 
Mode' on page 47 for more about this. 
 
19. [GO TO] Button:  
This button displays the locate window. 
Entering a locate point and then pres sing [F5] (GO TO) will move you to 
the selected position in the sequence. You can also memorize a locate point.  Select a point in your sequence 
and press the [GO TO] button.  Sele ct number you want to memorize 
and press [F2] (CAPTUR) to  memorize this point. 
20. [BAR] Buttons (' <<' And '>>'):  
These buttons let you move through your sequence by bars .  See 'STEP EDIT Mode' on page 47 for more about this. 
 
21. [REC] Button:  
This button enables recording of your performances.  Pressing [REC] + [PLAY START] or [REC] + [PLAY] will begin 
recording to a sequence.  Any existing  events in your sequence will be overwritten by your new performance. 
You can punch in by pressing [PLAY] + [REC] during playback and punch out by pressing the [REC] button a second 
time.  See page 24 for more about pu nching in and out on your MPC. 
New to the MPC5000 is 'Record Ready' mode.  When in 'Recor d Ready' mode, the MPC will start recording when a MIDI 
or MMC Start command is received.  To enter record ready mo de, simply press and release [REC].  The LED will start to 
blink, indicating that the MPC is in 'Record Ready' mode.  Th e MPC will start recording upon pressing [PLAY] or receiving 
a MIDI start command.  See page 23 fo r more about 'Record Ready' mode.  
Another new function added to the MPC5000 is the ability to  perform step recording from the MAIN page by holding 
down either the [REC] or [OVERDUB] button .  For more information, see page 23. 
22. [OVERDUB] Button:  
This button is quite similar in function to the [REC] button.  The only difference is that [OVERDUB] lets you add events to an existing sequence (overd ub) instead of overwriting existing events in the sequence. 
Press [OVERDUB] + [PLAY START] or [OVERDUB] + [PLAY] to  begin overdubbing a sequence .  To perform a punch-in, 
press [PLAY] + [OVERDUB] while the sequence is playin g.  Press [OVERDUB] to pu nch out while recording.

30. [PAD1] Through [PAD16]:  
These drum pads let you trigger the samples in your MP C, or play Synth Programs.  These pads also let you enter 
various modes, choose sequences, and mute tracks. 
 
 
31. [SYNTH]  
to the MPC 5000 is a virtual analog synth, with which you ca n create your own synth programs.  Synth programs make 
sound by a method called 'subtractive synthesis'.  From smooth, whistling leads, to huge, booming basses, to lush, 
spacious pads, synth programs can be used to create a vast array of sounds. 
Pressing the [SYNTH] button allows for quick access to the synth program on the current track, automatically add the 
first loaded synth program to the current track, or if no synth program is loaded, create a new, generic synth program 
for you to work with. It's best to think of the [SYNTH] button as a quick-fix shortcut to quickly get into synth programming.  
32. [ARP ON/OFF]  
This button allows you to turn on or off the arpeggiator quickly.  This button will light when the arpeggiator is on for the current track.  
33. [ARPEGGIATOR]  
New to the MPC5000 is the arpeggiator.  The arpeggiator will play in the order the pads being held down, or any notes 
being held down on an external MIDI keyboard.  This will allow for rapid playing not always possible when playing manually.  This is similar to pressing [NOTE REPEAT], but the advantages of an Arpeggiator (or 'Arp' for short) are that the notes play in a defined pattern.  For more on the Arpeggiator, see page 145. 30

 Front Panel  
The MPC5000’s front panel has several noteworthy features: 
39.  [MEMORY CARD SLOT]:  
The MPC5000’s [MEMORY CARD SLOT] accepts 'Type I' and 'T ype II' Compact Flash memory cards.  These cards are 
used to store your audio and song data. 
40. [DVD ROM] drive (Optional):  
Here, you can install an optional CD-RW/DVD ROM drive (Model #CDM-25).  Using this DVD drive, you can load WAV, 
AIFF or SND samples from CD, sample from CDs, create data  backups of your work, and record Redbook audio CDs to 
be played on any CD player. 
41. [FOOTSWITCH] Jacks (2):  
This is where you connect a momentary footswitch.  You can use a footswitch for several functions, including punching in or out, starting and stopping the sequencer, or even pl aying selected pads.  For more  information, see 'Using the 
Footswitches' on page 195. 
There are two types of footswitches: normal open (the contact is open when it is not pres sed), and normal closed (the 
contact is closed when it is not pressed).  When the MPC5000 is powered on, it automatically detects the type of foot 
switch connected, so you can use either type of foot switch. 
42. [PHONES] Input:  
Connect your stereo headphones to this jack.  This jack mirrors the signal from the [STE REO-OUT] jacks.  The volume 
of the headphones is controlled by the [MAIN VOLUME] knob. 
 Rear Panel  
All of the MPC5000’s inputs and outputs can be found on the rear of the unit.  They are as follows: 
 
43.  [STEREO OUT] Jacks:

45. [MIC/LINE] Switch:  
This switch sets whether the source plugged into the [RECORD IN] is a mic level or a line level source.  If set to MIC, 
the input will be preamped for optimal level.   
WARNING! Incorrectly setting this switch to MIC will yield dist ortion on devices not requiring a MIC Preamp.  Make 
sure your source requires amplific ation BEFORE setting this switch. 
46. [PHONO IN] Jacks (RCA):  
Use these jacks to connect a turntable or a CD player with RCA connections to your MPC.  The input level for this jack is 
controlled using the [REC GAIN] knob.  For best performance , be sure to set the [INPUT] phono/line switch properly. 
47. [ADAT] Digital Out:  
This output is used to connect ADAT capable digital devices.  This connection uses an optical cable to send 8 tracks of ADAT digital audio to a recording device.  For more information on configuring outputs, see page 195. 
48. [DIGITAL IN/OUT] Jacks (S/PDIF):  
These are the coaxial digital input/output.  This IN is to connect digital outputs such as a CD player and a DAT.  This OUT sends out the same signal as the [STEREO OUT]. 
49. [PHONO GROUND] nut:  
If your turntable requires it, use this nut to connect the turntable ground wire. 
50. [LINE / PHONO] Switch:  
This switch determines whether the [PHONO IN] RCA jacks will be line or phono level.  When set to PHONO, an RIAA-Class phono preamp will be applied to the in put.  Set this switch to the 'LINE' po sition, for sampling a line-level source 
(CD player, DJ mixer, Minidisk, etc.) and to the 'PHONO' position for reco rding with a turntable. 
WARNING! Incorrectly setting this switch to PHONO will yield distortion on devices not requiring amplification.  Make 
sure your turntable requires amplif ication BEFORE setting this switch. 
51. [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT 1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8] Jacks (1/4”):  
These individual outputs can be used to output each pad so und separately, allowing you to  send individual sounds to 
external mixers or effects.  Us ing these outputs, you can perform advanced mixing for your songs. 
52. [USB] Port:  
This USB 2.0 port allows for connecting your MPC to you comp uter, and allows you high speed access to you MPC's hard 
drive from your computer.  
53. MIDI] Jacks (2 IN, 4 OUT):  
The MPC5000 can send and receive MIDI data  through these jacks.  Connect one of  the MPC’s outputs to the MIDI input 
of an external device and on e of the MPC’s inputs to an  external device’s output.

Hooking Up Your MPC5000 
The following diagrams will demonstrate how the MPC5000 can be integrated into your recording setup.  Note that the 
diagrams below use every connector on the MPC and that your setup may vary from the ones shown. 
 Output Connectivity Example  
 
01. Connect the [STEREO OUT] to Powered Monitors 
This will allow the main mix of your MPC to be heard. 
02. Connect the [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUTS] to a multi-track Hard Disk recorder. 
This will allow individual samples and sounds to be sent individually to be recorded. 
Other examples of ways you can connect y our MPC5000's outputs include connecting the [STEREO OUT] to a mixing board to mix the MPC 
alongside other instruments, and using the [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUTS] to send cert ain sounds to external effects processors.  
Note: The MPC5000's outputs are pseudo balanced.  Use 'Balance d' or 'TRS' cables wherever possible to maximize 
sound quality, but no volume degradation will occur when using standard 'TS' type cables. 
 Analog Input Connectivity Example  
 
01. Connect a synthesizer or a Microphone to the [RECORD IN] jacks. 
Sources plugged into the [RECORD IN ] jacks can be sampled to be used in Sample Pr ograms.  The [RECORD-IN ] jacks are 1/4" / Mic combo 
jacks, allowing either type of connector to be used.  The input level for this jack is controlle d using the [REC GAIN] knob.  
Input sources can be monitored using the Input Thru feature.   See page 92 for more information.  Additionally, these 
sources can be used for Hard Disk Recording.  See pa ge 67 for more information on Hard Disk Recording. 
NOTE: The input sensitivity of these jacks are determined by the [LINE/MIC] switch. Setting this switch incorrectly can 
cause clipping and distortion.  Be sure to  determine whether your source is line le vel or mic level before connecting your 
device 


Introduction 12 
 
02. Connect the output of a turntable to the [PHONO IN] jacks.  
This will allow sampling from vinyl.  If your turntable requires a preamp, make sure the [LINE/PHONO] switch is set to 'PHONO'.   If the turntable 
requires grounding, connect the grounding wire to the [PHONO GROUND] nut.  
WARNING! Incorrectly setting this switch to PHONO will yield distortion on devices not requiring amplification.  Make 
sure your turntable requires amplif ication BEFORE setting this switch. 
 Digital Connectivity Example  
 
01. Connect the [DIGITAL IN/OUT] jacks to a digital recorder 
This connection is a 48 kHz S/PDIF type digital audio signal.  
NOTE:  The S/PDIF jack on the back of the MPC5000 looks like a standard RC A connector, but you should not use 
ordinary audio cables for this connection .  S/PDIF requires special 75-ohm 'digital audio' cables to work properly and will 
most likely result in very loud white noise if you use the wrong type of cables.  If you’re hearing clicks, pops, or white 
noise when using S/PDIF, your cable is the likely culprit. 
02. Connect the [ADAT] output to a Digital Recorder. 
This optical digital output suppor ts 8-channel ADAT format.  See 'Setting the ADAT Digital Output' on page 195 for more informa tion on 
configuring ADAT output.  
 USB Connectivity  
 
To connect your computer to the MPC5000, use a standard USB cable.   For more information on USB mode and connecting your MP C5000 to your computer, see 'Connecting the MPC5000 to 
Your Computer' on page 191. 


 13 
 
 MIDI Connectivity  
To connect your MIDI devices to the MPC5000, do the following: 
03. Connect the MIDI output of your MIDI device to one of the [MIDI IN] ports of the 
MPC5000. 
04. Connect the MIDI input of your MIDI device to one of the [MIDI OUT] ports on the

 Footswitch / Headphone Connectivity  
01. Connect a footswitch to each [FOOTSWITCH] jack 
Footswitches will allow you to start and stop your MPC, punch out, or do many other 
functions.  See page 195 for more information. 
02. Connect headphones to the [PHONES] input. 
This will allow you to monitor the output of the [STEREO OUTS].   The level of the 
headphones is controlled with the [MAIN VOLUME] knob. 



Introduction 14 
 
Basic Concepts and Terminology 
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following terms and concepts since you’ll encounter them 
throughout this manual. 
 Sequence  
A sequence is the most basic 'building block' of music you can 
compose on the MPC.  MIDI information from the MPC’s pads, 
buttons, and Q-LINK controls (or an  external keyboard) are recorded 
to tracks within a sequence.  Each sequence has 64 tracks and the MPC5000 can hold up to 99 separate sequences at one time. 
 
The length of a sequence can be set from 1 to 999 bars and yo u can theoretically create an entire song using only one 
sequence.  However, the MPC has a special SONG mode that  lets you arrange several short sequences together to 
create a song.  This allows you to create a sequence for each section of your song and to arrange and rearrange these sections however you’d like. 
For example:  by creating a separate sequence for the vers e, chorus, and hook of a song, you can use Song mode to 
quickly arrange the verse, chorus, and hook in any order yo u’d like.  This saves you from having to repeat the same 
section (such as the chorus) many time s throughout the song.  More importan tly, SONG mode makes editing and re-
arranging your song easy since you can simply change the order of sequence s (or number of repetitions for each 
sequence) instead of re-recording the entire song. Song mode is also where you can record audio tracks directly to the Hard Disk.  This will be discussed further later on. 
 Tracks  
The MPC 5000 has two types of tracks - sequence tracks and Hard Disk recording 
tracks.  Sequence tracks are found within sequences.  A sequence has 64 tracks and each track can record a performance .  For example, you can record the 
verses for a song on track one while re cording the choruses on track two.  
Alternatively, you can record diffe rent instruments on each track. 
 
Note that your performances are recorded as MIDI events an d the actual digital audio is not recorded onto a track.  
Because of this, you can edit your performance many different ways once the performance has been captured.  See the 
section below entitled 'Note number, velocity, and length' below for more on this. 
Hard Disk recording tracks are recorded in song mode.  Us ing Hard Disk recording, you can record a live performance, 
such as vocals or guitar, and have these tracks play back with your song.  The MPC5000 can have up to eight Hard Disk 
tracks.  Two can be reco rded simultaneously.  
 Song  
As we stated above under the 'Sequence' description, the MPC has a special 
SONG mode that allows you to arrange different sequences to gether to form a 
song.  Each time a new sequence is added to a song, we say a new 'step' is 
created within the song.  You can use so ng mode to arrange different sections 
(verse, chorus, hook, etc.) of a song together.   
 
Songs are created and arranged in the MPC5000’s SONG mode.  Each song can have up to 250 steps and the MPC5000 
can hold 20 songs at one time.  See 'SONG Mode' on  page 61 for more inform ation about this mode. 
Song mode is also where you can record audio tracks directly to the Hard Disk.  This will be discussed further later on.  
See HD RECORD on page 67 for more information. 
 Sample  
When you tap the pads on the MPC5000, you trigger various different sounds that we call 'samples.'  Samples are 
digitized snippets of audio that can be recorded using the [R ECORD IN], [PHONO IN] or [DIGITAL IN] on the rear of the 
MPC, loaded from a memory card, CD-ROM, internal Hard Disk, or transferred from a computer (via the USB port). 
Once a sample is loaded or recorded into the MPC5000, it can be manipulated in different ways.  For example, a sample can be trimmed down in length, looped, pitch-shifted or pr ocessed using one of the vari ous effects found within the 
MPC.  When you are finished editing your sample, you can assi gn it to one or more drum pads so that you can play the 
sample with those pads. 


 15 
The MPC5000 supports 16-bit samples at any sample rate (aud io imported at sample rates higher than 44.1k is 
automatically downsampled during playback).  Samples can be either mono or stereo. 
 Drum Pad  
The MPC5000 has 16 pressure sensitive pads that are used to  trigger sounds.  These pads are arranged in 4 banks 
called 'A,' 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.'  These banks can be quickly se lected using the [PAD BANK] buttons giving you easy access to 
64 different sounds.  Use PROGRAM mode  to assign samples to these pads. 
 Sample Program  
A Sample Program is a file that contains  a list of all samples to be used, and 
settings for each sample (i.e., pad assignments, loop points, pitch tuning, effects, 
etc.)  The MPC’s PROGRAM mode is where you can edit and assign samples.  The MPC5000 can have a total of 128 programs in memory.   
There are two kinds of programs that us e samples for their sound source: Sample 
Programs, mostly used for creating drum  programs and easy and quick assigning 
of samples to a pad, and Keygroups Prog rams. With Keygroup Programs, you can 
use one sample (or more) and spread it across two or more keys and play the 
sample chromatically over a keyboard. That way there is no need to sample every key of, for instance, a piano. For mo re information on Keygroups Sample 
Programs see page  130.  
 
 Synth Programs  
Synth (short for 'Synthesizer') programs  are new to the MPC5000.  The concept of a Synth is an instrument that is capable of producing a very wide range of  sounds electronically.  Synths have be en the basis of popular music since the 
late 60's, across just about every genre of popular music.  Browsing and playing through the included Synth Programs 
will give you an idea of the vast variety of sound s that Synth Programs are capable of producing.  
 Note Number, Velocity, and Length  
When you are recording a sequence, every time you tap a pa d, three key pieces of data are recorded on a track: 
The note number (i.e., which pad you struck) 
The note velocity (i.e., how hard you struck the pad) The note length (i.e., how long you held the pad down) 
Once this information is recorded, the MPC can playback your  performance exactly as it was recorded.  You can also do 
things like edit or delete notes, overdub (add) more notes to an existing performance, tighten up your timing through 
the Timing Correct feature, and much more.  These various functions are covered in detail in 'The Sequencer' on page 
21. 
If you are familiar with MIDI sequencing, the terms and conc epts described above may already be familiar to you.  If 
you’re new to MIDI sequencing, don’t worry—the MPC5000 handles most tasks automatically.  All other tasks that 
require user input are covered throughout this manual. 
 RAM 
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a space where you can temp orarily load audio and MIDI (song) data.  The MPC5000 
ships with 64MB (megabytes) of RAM and can hold about 768 seconds (over 12 minutes) of mono sound.  The EXM-E3 expansion module raises your memory to 192MB and increases your total recording time to over 36 minutes. 
Note that RAM contents are deleted when  the MPC5000 is turned off.  If you wish to keep your work, you must save 
your work on either a memory card or the internal Hard Disk. 
 Memory Card  
Compact flash memory is similar to the Hard Drive, but in a portable format, allowing you to take your projects with 
you, or to back up your data.   
About Memory Cards:   There are several types of memory cards available today.  The MPC5000 supports 'type I' and 
'type II' compact flash cards only, so please make sure you purchase the correct type of card. 


Introduction 16 
 
Operating Modes 
The MPC5000 has several different modes of operation.  Each of these modes handles specific tasks such as arranging 
your sequences (SONG mode) or recording your own samples (REC SAMPLE mode). 
Each mode can be accessed using the MPC5000’s drum pads.  To enter these modes, press the [MODE] button and tap the pad associated with the mode you want.  The name of each mode is listed in yellow at th e upper right of each pad.  
 MAIN Mode ([MAIN])  
This is the start page of th e MPC5000 and is displayed when 
the unit is powered on.  Use this mode to record your 
sequences.  Should you get lost , pressing the [MAIN] button 
will always return you to this page. 
 Q-LINK Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 1])  
Here, the function of the Q-LINK slider can be set.  Various real-time performance data an d Effect parameters can be 
recorded and entered here, as well as sending MIDI continuous controllers to external modules. 
 DISK Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 3])  
Here, you can access the various storage media available to you.  This is where files, such as samples and sequences, can be saved, or retrieved and edited. 
 REC SAMPLE Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 4])  
Here is where you can record your own samples for playback on the MPC5000's pads. 
 TRIM Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 5])  
This is where you can edit individual sa mples, deleting silence, adjusting overall volume of recorded samples and so 
forth. 
 PROGRAM Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 6])  
Depending on if the type of program is Sample, Keygroup or Synth, this page will allow individual samples to be assembled into a group for playback on th e individual pads, playback of a sample over several pads or allow editing of a 
Synth program's virtual analog parameters. 
 MIXER Mode ([ MODE]+[Pad 7]  
This mode is where the mixing of individual pads or complete sequencer tracks can be done  graphically, much like using 
an external mixing board.  Which output the signal is sent to, and what effect bus and how much effect is used per 
sound is also determined here.  
 MIDI/SYNC Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 8])  
Here, you can sync up your MPC5000 with other devices, and control different aspects of MIDI. 
 OTHER Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 9])  
Here, you can find different settings that don’t fit easily into other categories, such as Master level, pad sensitivity, etc. 
 ARP Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 10])  
This mode allows you to edit the Arpeggiator.  This is mode  can also be edited by pressing the [ARPEGGIATOR] button.  
For more on the Arpeggiator, see page 145. 


 17 
 
 EFFECTS Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 11])  
This is where different digital effects, such as reverb, delay and flange can be applied to different pads etc.  Also, 
master effects, such as parametric EQs and co mpression can be applied to the Master output. 
 SEQ EDIT Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 12])  
This is where sequences can be edited and transposed, as well as other types of editing. 
 STEP EDIT Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 13])  
Here, the sequence can be edited with greater precision,  editing the parameters of individual notes and events. 
 GRID EDIT Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 14])  
'GRID EDIT' mode allows you to edit the individual note and pad events on a track in a graphical interface.  This mode is 
ideal for fine editing of different tracks in a sequence visually.  
 SONG Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 15])  
Here is where individual sequences ca n be organized into a single song. 
 HD RECORD Mode ([MODE]+[Pad 16])  
T h i s  b r i n g s  y o u  i n t o  H A R D  D I S K  R E C O R D I N G  M O D E .   H e r e ,  p e r f o r m a n c e s ,  s u c h  a s  v o c a l s ,  g u i t a r ,  o r  o t h e r  l i v e  instruments can be recorded directly in  to and played from the internal hard  drive alongside the current song.   
 SYNTH Programs ([SYNTH])  
Pressing the [SYNTH] button will quickly bring you to the firs t synth track in your sequence, bring you to the last synth 
program you edited, or create a synth program on a new track.  It's best to think of the [SYNTH] button as a quick-fix 
shortcut to quickly get into synth programming.  This mode can also be entered by selecting a track on the MAIN page 
that uses a Synth-type program,  and entering PROGRAM mode.  
 





 
Chapter 2:  Basic Operation 
In this chapter, we will describe the basic operation of the MPC5000. 
 MAIN Page  
This is the main screen of the MPC 5000, where you record and play back 
sequences.  You can go back to this  page at any time  by pressing the 
[MAIN] button.  If at any time you get lost while operating the MPC5000 
and want to go back to this page, simply press the [MAIN] button.  You 
cannot go back to the MAIN page by pressing [MAIN] button while processing (e.g.  Recording, loading/saving etc...). 
 Cursor, Cursor Buttons, [DATA] wheel  
The highlighted reverse colored squa re on the screen is called the 
'Cursor'. 
You can move the cursor on the screen  using the four [CURSOR] buttons on 
the panel.  Usually they move to specific locations such as to the right of a 
colon (:).  Those locations are called 'fields', and will be indicated in the manual by single quotes.  This is where you can make various settings, or enter values.  To change the settings of a field, select the field and turn the [ D A T A ]  w h e e l  o n  t h e  p a n e l .   T h i s  o p eration, selecting a field by using a 
cursor button and changing its settings with the [DATA] wheel, is the most basic operation of MPC5000. 
While in MAIN Mode, press and hold th e [SHIFT] button, and press the [UP] 
cursor button to quickly access the 'Sequence' field from anywhere.   Press and hold the [SHIFT] button and press the 
[DOWN] cursor button to quickly access the 'Track' Field.  
 Function Buttons  
Six buttons ([F1] to [F6]) aligned under the LCD (liquid crystal display) are Function Buttons.  Those buttons correspond to each of the six functions that are displayed on the bottom of the LCD.  Pressing each button activates its corresponding function.  The function 
that each button represen ts depends on where you 
are. 
When the LCD looks like this, pressing a function 
button starts some processing or displays a window. 
  When the LCD looks like this, you can switch pages using functi on buttons [F1] to [F3].  The currently selected page is 
displayed with white letters on a blue background.  Pres sing F4, F5 and F6 buttons does not make any changes. 
 Some pages display the page  selection and processing 
function at the same time (see below).  In this case, 
use [F1] and [F2] for swit ching pages, and [F5] and 
[F6] for activating processing.  You cannot use [F3] and [F4]. 
In this manual, function buttons are described 
something like this: '[F1] (TRIM) button'- in the bracket, it shows the function displayed on the LCD. 
 [WINDOW] Button  
The MPC5000 has so many functions that they cannot be disp layed in one screen.  For efficiency, each page only 
displays the most frequently used functions.  If you want to make an advanced setting, press the [WINDOW] button.  This opens a window for the detailed setting of the selected field.  This is not available for all fields.  When you select a field in which you can use the [WINDOW] button, the LED of the button is lit.

Basic Operation 20 
 [MODE] Button  
With the MPC5000, each function (such as recording samples,  editing samples, assigning samples to each pad, editing 
sequence data, loading from memory cards, etc…) has a se parate screen.  These screens are called 'modes'.  For 
example, you will use the RECORD mode to record samples, and the TRIM mode to edit samples etc.  By pressing the 
[MODE] button and hitting a pad, you can switch modes.  Th e mode that a pad corresponds to is displayed above each 
pad. 
 
Setting Names  
The MPC5000 handles various types of data, from sound data (such as samples and programs) to performance data 
(such as sequences and tracks).  This data is managed by na ming.  In this section, you will learn how to name these 
items. 
Select a field which you wish to name with the cursor and turn the [DATA] wheel.  The Name windows will appear. 
Note: In this window, the cursor is displayed as an underscore instead of highlights. 
You can enter the name, either by using the keypad or by using the [DATA] wheel.  
 Entering letters with [DATA] wheel  
You can change letters selected with a cursor by turning [DATA] wheel in the Name window.  
Move the cursor with RIGHT/LEFT cursor button and enter letters.  You can enter letters using both [DATA] wheel and pads.  
 Entering letters with the Numeric Keypad  
Much like a telephone, three or four letters are assigned to each number on the keypad.  By 
h i t t i n g  a  n u m b e r ,  t h e  c o r r e s p o n d i n g  l e t t e r  i s  e n t e r e d .   B e l o w ,  w e  w i l l  d e s c r i b e  h o w  t o  e n t e r  ' B a s s  0 1 '  i n s t e a d  o f  'Sequence 01'.  
01. Press the UP cursor button to make the first letter capitalized. 
Pressing the UP cursor button allows you to enter a capitalized letter. 
02. Hit [2] two times. 
Hitting [2] once enters 'a', twice enters 'b', three times enters 'c', four times enters '2'. 
03. Press the RIGHT cursor button and move the cursor to the right. 
If you enter the next letter using a different button, the cu rsor will move to the right automatically.  However, 
when you enter the letters which are assigned to the same  button, you need to press the [RIGHT] cursor button 
to move the cursor manually.  In th is example, A and B are assigned to the same button.  So, you need to move 
the cursor manually. 
04. The next letter is a lower-case letter (' a '), so press the [DOWN] cursor button. 
Pressing the [DOWN] cursor button allows you to enter lower case letters. 
05. Hit [2] once. 
A lower case letter 'a' is entered. 
06. Hit [7] four times.  The cursor will move to the right automa tically and a lower-ca se 's' is entered. 
07. Press the RIGHT cursor button to move the cursor to the right and hit the [7] four more times. 
This will enter a second 's'. 
08. Press the RIGHT cursor button to move the cursor to the right and press RIGHT cursor button holding the 
[SHIFT] button. 
The [SHIFT] + RIGHT cursor button inserts space. 
09. Press the right cursor button to move  the cursor one step to the right, and press the '0' button four times to 
insert a zero. 
10. Press the '1' button four times. 
11. Press the RIGHT cursor button to move the cursor to the right, and press the LEFT cursor button four times 
holding the [SHIFT] button. 
The [SHIFT] + LEFT cursor buttons delete selected lett ers.  Now 'Bass 01' is entered instead of 'Sequence 01'. 
12. Press [F5] (ENTER) to confirm the entry and close the window. 
Pressing [F4] (CANCEL) cancels t he entry and closes the window.  In this case, the name does not change. 


 
Chapter 3:  The Sequencer 
The MPC5000 has a sequencer feature that allows you to record/playback your performance.  With the sequencer 
feature, you can record the performance  you created with the pads, and by playing back the recorded data, you can 
reproduce your performance.  The actual  performance will be recorded on a track within a sequence.  For more 
information on sequences and tracks, see the section entitled 'Basic Concepts and Terminology' on page 14. 
The performance data you made by hitting the pads will be recorded on a track as events  A track can contain other 
events, such as Q-LINK controller information, tempo chan ge etc… When you are using the MPC5000 with an external 
MIDI device, you can record the data from the external keyboard as MIDI events. 
Note: The sequencer feature records only pe rformance data (when and which pad you hit, etc…).  It does not record 
the actual sound.  To record audio tracks, see 'HD RECORD' on page 67. 
 
Main Page 
This is the page where you record/playback sequences.  Th is is the MPC5000’s main operation mode and, unlike the 
other pages, you can display this page by pressing the [MAIN] button at any time. 
 'Now'  
The 'Now' field, which is located in the upper left corner of the screen.  When you record/playback a sequence, the 
display updates constantly to show the current position of the sequence. When the sequence is stopped, you can move 
the cursor to the 'Now' field to set the time manually. 
The 'Now' field displays time in two ways.   
Bars and Beats 
Bars and Beats will display the current time of the sequence by bar, beat and 
tick from left to right.  For example, '002.03:000' means the third beat in the 
second bar.  When you record/playback a sequence, the display updates constantly to show the current  position of the sequence. 
A tick is a unit that divides a beat (1/4  note) into 960 parts. For example, 1 
beat equals one 1/4 note (960 ticks), so one 1/8 note equals the half of 1 beat, which is 480 ticks.  
Below is the relationship between note and tick: 
1/4 note = 960 ticks 1/8 note = 480 ticks 1/16 note = 240 ticks 
1/4 triplets = 640 ticks 1/8 triplets = 320 ticks 1/16 triplets = 160 ticks 
1/32 Note = 120 ticks 1/32 triplets =   80 ticks 1/64 note =   60 ticks 
1/64 triplets =   40 ticks     
Absolute Time 
Another way the 'Now' field will display time is absolute time.  Absolute time will show actual length of the sequence in hours , minutes, 
seconds, and frames.  For exampl e, '00h03m07s03f' means three minutes, seven se conds, and three frames.  Unlike when displayed 
in BARS:BEATS:TICK, the 'Now' field will increase in time linearly  as a sequence plays.  In other words, If you have a two bar 
sequence, and you let it play for 5 minutes, BARS:BEATS:TICK will show the time counting to bar two, then looping back to one, but 
viewing the HOURS:MINUTES:FRAMES display will count up to '00h05m00s00f' showing the sequence played for five minutes. 
Frame is a subdivision of seconds sent via MIDI in a format call ed MIDI TIME CODE, or MTC.   MTC is a standard that has been used 
as a timing standard for many years by both the Audio and the Video industry.  The MPC5000 can sync to the frame rate of extern al 
devices, or generate its own timing data to sl ave other devices to its internal clock.  For more on MIDI TIME CODE, see page 18 6. 
To toggle between 'Bars and Beats' and 'Absolute Time', do the following:  
01. In MAIN Mode, select the 'NOW' field as shown.  
 
02. Scroll with the [DATA] wheel,  or press the [+] button.   
03. The screen will change as shown. 
 
 


The Sequencer 22 
 
 'Sequence'  
A Sequence is the most basic unit when creating data with the 
MPC5000.  Performance data from the MIDI keyboard or pad can be recorded on each track within a sequence.  You can select a sequence in this field by turning the [DATA] wheel, or typing in a number with 
the [NUMERIC KEYPAD].  You can have up to 99 sequences in memory at any one time.  Empty sequences are indicated as (unused).  All the settings in the MAIN page can be set separately for each sequence.  
 'Track' field  
A sequence has 64 tracks.  You can re cord different parts separately to 
each track. You can, for example, record Piano sounds on track 1, Bass 
on track 2, Organ on track 3 etc… In the 'Track' field, you can select a track within the sequence selected in the 'Sequence' field. An unused track is indicated as (unused). You can set 'Mute', 'MIDI', 'Velocity%', 'Type', and 'Program' fields se parately for each track.  
 'Track Status' field  
The 'Track Status' field shows a smal l representation of each of the 64 
tracks in the current sequence.  When an event is played on each track, the track indicator for that particular track will blink.  The Square box indicates which track is currently acti ve in the 'Track' field.  Using the 
'Track Status' field, you can find stray notes on tracks and visually see where each event is happening. 
Also, tracks set as Continuous Sample  Tracks will be displayed as a '+' 
symbol.  For more on Continuous  Sample Tracks, see page 37. 
Furthermore, when you use the Mute or Solo button in Main mode on a track, you will see this in the Track Status 
field(s) as well. Muted tracks will have a small 'x' on  their respective dots in this ‘Track Status’ field. 
 
Recording the Performance 
In this section, you will learn how to record the performance you made wi th pads to tracks in a sequence. 
01. To record your performance data to a sequence, you need to load a program to the MPC5000.  By default, the MPC5000 automatically loads preset programs and demo sequences from the internal ROM.  Here, we assume that you have already loaded a program to the MPC5000.  If you have not done so, do this now by loading a program from a memory card, or by re cording a sample and assigning it to  a pad, etc… For more information 
on loading a program, see the 'Saving and Loading (DIS K Mode)' section on page 165.  For more information 
on recording a sample, see the 'Sampling' section on page 95. 
02. Press the [MAIN] button to open the MAIN page. 
The [MAIN] button displays the MAIN page where you record your sequences. 
03. In the 'Sequence' field, select a sequence to  which you wish to record your performance. 
You can select any sequence for recording a performance , but here, select a sequence that says 'unused'. 
'Unused' indicates that th e sequence is not used. 
04. Select the 'TRACK' field and select an unused track. 
Your performance will be recorded on the track you select in the 'Track' field.  You can select any track, but here select the first unused track (i.e. 
'01-(unused)'). 
05. In the 'Program' field, se lect the program to play. 
Select the 'Program' field, and scroll with the [DAT A] wheel until the desired program is displayed. 
You can select any program currently in RAM in the 'Program' field by tu rning the [DATA] wheel. 
06. Hit pads to check the sounds that are assigned to the pads. 
This will play the program selected in the 'Program' field. 
07. Press the [PLAY START] button while holding the [REC] button. 
The recording will start after 4 counts. 
08. Play the pads to record your performance. 
 



 23 
By default, the sequence is set to 2 bars.  After recording fo r 2 bars, the MPC5000 will start playing back the recorded perfor mance.  You can add 
to your original performance by continuing to play the pads when the track loops.  The MPC5000 aut omatically switches to 'overd ub' recording 
and adds to the performance. 
09. Stop overdub recording by pressing [STOP] button. 
10. Press the [PLAY] button to pl ay your recorded performance. 
11. If you do not like the performance, you can start a new recording by pressing the [PLAY START] button while 
holding the [REC] button. 
This deletes the previously recorded performance data and starts a new recording. 
12. To add to the already recorded performance, press the [PLAY START] button while holding the [OVERDUB] 
button. 
This will play back the currently recorded performance, an d you can add the new performance by playing the pads. 
Tip: If you select another sequence in the Main page, you can record a new performance separately.  By playing back 
those sequences, you can create an entire song. 
Tip: By default, the MPC5000 is set to load a demo sequence au tomatically when you turn it on.  If you wish to remove 
the demo sequence and start from scratch, see 'Deleting All Sequences' section on page 33. 
 'Record Ready' Mode  
New to the MPC5000 is 'Record Ready' Mode.  When only th e [REC] button is pressed and released, the RECORD light 
will blink, indicating that the MPC5000 is in 'Record Re ady' Mode.  The MPC5000 will now wait for a MIDI START 
command.  
To use Record Ready mode, do the following. 13. Press and release the [REC] button.  
The MPC5000's RECORD light will blink, indicati ng it is now in 'Record Ready' Mode.  
14. When you are ready, press 'Sta rt' on the master device.   
Recording will start.  
 Step Recording  
The MPC5000 allows step recording right from the MAIN page. When you hit a pad,  or when the MPC5000 receives MIDI 
data from an external device, the MPC records the event in the current time position (the time displayed in the 'Now' 
field). With Step Recording, you can move to the desired time position by setting the time position in the 'Now' field, and you can add events to the desired ti me position one by one. This method, recording each event individually when 
MPC5000 is in the stop mode, is called step recording. This function allows for complex passages to be recorded with 
ease.  
To Step Record from the MA IN page, do the following: 
01. Stop the current sequence  if it is running.  
02. Set the NOW to the time you would like to insert notes 
03. Press and hold the [REC] or [OVER DUB] button.  
04. The MPC is now in STEP RECORD Mode for as long as [REC] or [OVER DUB] is held.  
05. Play a pad.  
The MPC will record the note played in the current position. There are several options you can set to fine tune your 
STEP RECORD performance. Step Recording from the Main Page shares settings wi th STEP EDIT. For further information 
on STEP EDIT, see page 47. 
 Playing Back a Sequence  
You can play back a recorded sequence by pressing the [PLAY START] button. The sequence will be played repeatedly 
until you press the [STOP] button. If you press the [PLAY] button again, the MPC5000 will resume the playback from where the previous play back was stopped. 
 Playing Several Sequences in Series  
You can play back several sequences in a series by using the Next Sequence feature. The Next Sequence feature allows you to select the next sequence to play , while playing back a sequence, so that you can play the sequences in a series. 
While a sequence is playing, you can select the next sequence to be played from the Main page by turning the [DATA] wheel or using the numeric keypad at the 'Sequence' field. 


The Sequencer 24 
01. From the Main page, select a sequence and press [PLAY]. 
02. While the selected sequence is playing, change the 'Sequence' 
field to another sequence using the [DATA] wheel. The screen will change as follows:  
The 'Sequence' field continues to show the sequence number that is currently 
playing,  
The '>' field shows next sequence that will be played.  
03. After playing back the currently selected sequence to the end, 
the MPC5000 will start playing back the sequence you've 
selected. By repeating this step, you can play back several sequences seamlessly. 
When next sequence is selected, you can start to play  next sequence immediately by pressing [STEP>] button. 
When next sequence is selected, you can cancel se lected next sequence by pressing [<STEP] button. 
Tip: With the [NEXT SEQ] button, you can select the next sequence with a pad. For more information, see the 'Selecting 
a sequence with pads' section on Page 84. 
Tip: In SONG mode, you can set the order to play sequences.  For more information, see the 'SONG mode' section on 
Page 61. 
 Punch In/Punch Out  
You can start the recording in the middle of th e sequence during the playback ('Punch In'). 
You can also stop the recording in the middle of the sequen ce and resume the playback ('Punch Out'). This is useful 
when you re-record part of  the recorded sequence. 
Punch In 
Press the [PLAY] or the [PLAY START] button to play back a sequence. At the point where you wish to start the recording, press the 
[PLAY] button while holding the [REC] but ton. The MPC5000 will start recording. 
If you press the [PLAY] button and the [OVERDUB] button instead, the MPC5000 will start the overdubbing. 
Punch Out 
If you press the [REC] or the [OVERDUB] button during the recording/overdubbing, the MPC5000 will stop the recording/overdubbin g 
and resume the playback. 
Other Useful Features for Recording Sequences 
 Undo and Redo  
When overdubbing sequences, you can cancel the last re cording and reset to the sett ing before the recording. 
To UNDO a sequence recording, just press the [UNDO] button. The LED of the [UNDO] button will be off and only the last added recording will be deleted. To restore the last recording, press the [UNDO] bu tton again to light the LED. 
Note: You can use the [UNDO] button only for the last recording. 
Tips:  The MPC5000 is the first MPC to be able to undo and redo sequence recordings while the sequence is playing. This 
allows you to actively audition the record ing while the sequence plays to decide if you wish to keep the last recording.  



 25 
 
Erase 
You can delete a certain pad performance by using [ERASE] button. There ar e two ways to use this feature: by deleting 
in real-time during overdub, or by selecting a pad and part to delete in the Erase page. 
 Deleting In Real Time  
01. Press [PLAY START] and [OVERDUB] to start overdub recording. 
02. Press the pad you wish to delete wh ile holding down the [ERASE] button. 
While the [ERASE] button is held, pressing a pad will not record the pad, but delete any  instances of the pad while it is being  held down.  
 Deleting From the Erase Screen  
Performance data will be recorded in a tr ack as an event. In the Erase window, you can select specific events in a track 
to delete. 
01. Press the [STOP] button to stop the sequence. 
02. Press the [ERASE] button. 
03. Select the track you wish to delete events from in the 'Track' 
field.  
This field will default to the current trac k, but can be switc hed to any of the 64 
sequence tracks. To erase events from ALL Tracks, scroll to '00-ALL TRACKS'. 
04. Select the range of time you would like the selected events from  
This will default to the entire length of t he sequence, but you can set this to any range you wish. For example, to delete only  the event in the first 
bar from 2-bar sequence, set '001.01.00 - 002.01.00'. In th is case, the event at 002.01.00 point will not be deleted. 
If you set the end point '002.01.00' like this, the area right before the end point will be included in the area. 
05. In the 'Erase' field, se lect the type of events to be deleted.  
This will default to 'NOTE ONLY', 
The following are also available:  
ALL EVENTS 
EXCEPT NOTE PITCH BEND CTRL CHANGE PRG CHANGE CH PRESS POLY PRESS EXCLUSIVE EFFECT TEMPO REAL TIME TRACK MUTE PAD MUTE 
With CTRL CHANGE, POLY PRESS and REAL TIME you can be even more  specific, selecting individual controller numbers or erasing po ly 
pressure events associated only with a certain note. 
06. Select the 'Note/Pad' field. 
This field will default to PADS or NOTES, depending on the track type.  ALL is selected in the 'Value' field as the default. Whi le Pads is selected 
on 'Parameter' field, you can select individual pads in the 'Val ue' field by hitting the specific pads you would like to delete  directly. You can also 
select a pad with the [DATA] Wheel. 
If the selected track is a MIDI type track,  instead of DRUM, this field will display 
Notes as follows: 0(C -2) - 127(G 8) 
The field for 'Notes' consis ts of two parts, Low note and High note. Low note (left) 
sets lower range of MIDI note and High note (right) sets high range of MIDI note. In 
this page, you can set note range with an external MIDI keyboard. The range is updated whenever a MIDI note is received.  
For example, when the MPC5000 receives onl y one note, such as  C 3, the range is 
set to C 3-C 3. When MPC5000 receive multiple notes, for example C 3, D 3 and E 
3, then the range is set to C 3-E 3. 
If you wish to delete all events, leave it as ALL. To delete only events on a specific 
pad, hit the pad to delete. You can select several pads. If you hit a different pad by mistake, you can cancel the selection by  hitting the pad again. 
To restart the pad selection, turn the [DAT A] wheel to the left. The value in the Note  field will be reset to ALL so that you c an select pad from the 
beginning. 



The Sequencer 26 
 
07. Press [F5] (DO IT). 
The operation starts and the events of the select ed pad within the selected area will be deleted. 
Erase can also be used to delete events from tracks other than the currently selected track, or to delete only specific types o f events. You can 
also specify only a certain time range from which to delete events. 
Tip: When you delete events with the Eras e field set to ALL EVENT, the MPC5000 will delete other events in the selected 
area as well as pad events. When you delete events with the Erase field set to EXCEPT Note, the MPC5000 will delete 
the other events other than the pad events in the selected area. 
Timing correct 
When recording a pad performance, it is hard to play the pa ds to the tempo. By using the timing correct feature, you 
can correct the timing of the pad event you recorded by hi tting pads. There are two ways to use this feature: by 
correcting the timing in real time duri ng the recording, and by correcting th e recorded event after the recording. 
 Real time timing correction  
You can correct the timing in re al-time during the recording. 
01. When a sequence is playing, press [F1] (T.C.) button in the MAIN page. 
02. In the 'Note Value' field, set the value for timing correction. 
For example, if you set '1/16', each position of th e performance data will be moved to the nearest 1/16 note. 
You can set the Note values as follows. 
1/4 note 1/8 note 1/16 note 
1/4 triplets 1/8 triplets 1/16 triplets 
1/32 Note 1/32 triplets 1/64 note 1/64 triplets OFF  
Tip: If you press [F1] (T.C.) button during recording/playback , a small Timing Correct wind ow will be displayed while 
you are holding the button. You can use the 'Note value' field of this window to change the value for timing correction. 
It makes it easier to change the value during the recording. 
 Swing  
You can set the swing value in the 'Swing%' field. With the swing feature, the even numbered events set in the 'Note 
value' field will be off the rhythm according to the value in  the 'Swing%' field. With this feature you can create the 
shuffle groove. 
01. Press [F4] (CLOSE) button. 
This closes the window. 
Tip: Thanks to an ultra-high sequencer resolution of 960 pu lses per quarter note, the MPC5000 is the first MPC to be 
able to apply MPC Style SWING to triplets.  
 Correcting the timing of recorded events  
You can correct the timing of recorded events. 01. When a sequence is stopped, press the [F1] (T.C.) button in the MAIN page. 
Timing Correct window will be displayed as above. 
02. In the Note value' field, set the value for timing correction. 
For example, if you set '1/16', each position of th e performance data will be moved to the nearest 1/16 note. 
You can set the Note values as follows:  
1/4 note 1/8 note 1/16 note 
1/4 triplets 1/8 triplets 1/16 triplets 1/32 Note 1/32 triplets 1/64 note 1/64 triplets OFF  
03. Press the [F5] (FIX) button. 
Timing Correct window will be displayed. 


 27 
04. In the 'RANGE' field, select the area to correct the timing. 
05. In the 'Note' field, hit the pad you wish to correct the timing. 
To correct the timing of all events, leave it as ALL. To correct the timing of only events on a specific pad, hit the pad. You can select several pads. 
If you hit a different pad by mistake, you can cancel the sele ction by hitting the pad again. To restart the pad selection, turn the [DATA] wheel to 
the left. The value in the 'Note' field will be reset to ALL so that you can select pad from the beginning. 
06. Press [F3] (DO IT) button. 
The timing correction will start and the window will be closed. 
 Swing  
You can set the swing value in the 'Swing%' field. With the swing feature, the even numbered events set in the 'Note 
value' field will be off the rhythm according to the value in the Swing%' field. With this feature you can create the 
shuffle groove. 
 Shift Timing  
'Shift Timing' can be used to align notes ahead of the beat (allowing for a rushed feel) or behind the beat, to create a 
more 'backbeat' type feel. Set this  value to 0 for no timing shift. 
 Strength  
Strength controls how rigidly the track will be quantized. In other words, a 0% setting will not quantize the track at all, 
whereas a 100% setting will cause every note to snap perfectly in to position within the beat. Settings closer to 0% will 
allow note timing to be more relaxed and true to the original performance, while settings closer to 100% will make the track more precise.  
Experimentation with the 'Strength' parameter can yield accurate tracks that still maintain a 'human' feel. 
 Window  
This parameter lets you set the width of the affected area  surrounding each timing point. At 100% all notes move 
toward the nearest timing correct point. At lower percentages, notes far from a quantization point may not be moved. Using this parameter, you can set how far away a note has to  fall from an "ideal" Timing Correct position  before the 
Timing Correct process ignores that note.  
Click/Metronome 
In this section, you will learn about vari ous settings for the metronome (click sound). 
01. When a sequence is in stop mode, Press [F2] (CLICK) button in the MAIN page. 
The Click/Metronome window will be displayed as on the right. 
'Count In' field 
You can set how soon the recording/playback should start after the [PLAY] or the [PLAY START] bu tton is pressed; right after th e key 
is pressed, or after a 1-bar count. 
OFF 
Recording/playback will star t right after the key is 
pressed without a count. REC ONLY There will be a count only for recording/overdub. 
Playback will be started without a count. 
REC+PLAY 
There will be a count for both recording and

04. Press [F5] (DO IT) button 
That applies the new setting and closes the window. 
 
Tip: when you increase the length of the sequence, blank bars  are added at the end of your sequence. If you decrease 
the length of a sequence, the last bars of the existing sequ ence are not played, but unlike previous MPC's, these bars 
are NOT truncated. This means that the length can be adjusted without losing the end bars of your sequence!  
Tip: In SONG mode, you can also set a specific order for se quences playback. For more information, see 'SONG Mode' 
on page 61. 
 Setting the Time Signature of the Sequence  
By default, the time of a sequence is set to the 4/4 time, but you can change the setting. 
01. In the MAIN page, select 'Time Sig' field. 
The 'Time Sig' field displays the current value. 
02. Turn the [DATA] wheel or press the [WINDOW] button. 
The TIME SIGNATURE window will be displayed. 
The upper part of the screen indicates the number of bars. The currently selected 
time is displayed below it. 
03. Select the desired time signature, and set to this. 
Select the bar to change the time with the right/left cursor keys and change the time 
with [DATA] wheel.  
04. Press [F5] (DO IT) 
That changes the time signature of the bars and closes the window. 
Note: if a bar becomes lengthened due to a time signature chan ge, blank space is added to the end of the bar. If you 
decrease the length of a sequence, the last bars of the existing sequence are not played , but unlike pr evious MPC's, 
these bars are NOT truncated. This means that the length of a sequence can be adjusted without losing the end bars of 
your sequence! 


The Sequencer 30 
 
 Setting Tempo  
You can set the beats per minute, or tempo, in the MAIN page by sele cting the 'BPM' field. 
You can set the BPM for a sequence between 30.0 and 300.0 beats per minute. 
When the MPC5000 is set to follow an extern al source via MIDI clock, the 'BPM' field 
will display 'EXT', along with the tempo being received in brackets for external 
tempo.  
You can change the BPM after you create the sequence, or change the BPM 
anywhere in a sequence by inserting the tempo change event in the STEP EDIT 
mode. (See page 47 for more information.) 
 Tap Tempo   
You can set the tempo using the [TAP TEMPO] button as well as in the 'Tempo' field. 
Press the [TAP TEMPO] button along to the desired temp o, and the MPC5000 will calculate the tempo based on the 
timing that you tap. The sequence’s tempo will automatically be set to the tapped value. 
The MPC5000 takes the average of four taps of the pad, but yo u can adjust the number of taps used to calculate BPM in 
the 'Tap average' field in OTHER mode. 
 Changing Tempo of All Sequences At One Time  
You can change the tempo of all sequences to the same tempo at one time. You can change the tempo of each 
sequence at any time after you create the sequence, but it is useful to change all the sequence at one time when you 
are creating one song with several sequences. 
01. In the MAIN page, select th e 'BPM' field and press the 
[WINDOW] button. 
 
 
 The TEMPO CHANGE window will be displayed.

 31 
 Setting the Loop for a Sequence  
By default, the MPC5000 has the sequence loop feature on. It is useful 
when you create a short sequence. With the sequence loop feature, you can overdub a new performance on top of a previous performance, allowing you to layer your tracks while playing back a sequence repeatedly. 
However, when you are working on a long song, created as a single 
sequence, it may be better to loop only the part of the song that you are working on. Also, when you wish to play freely without worrying about the bars or times, it is better to turn the loop feature off. In this section you will learn how to set the loop feature. 
01. In the MAIN page, select the 'Loop' field.  
You can switch the sequence loop features on or off by turning the [DATA] wheel. In this field, you can only set whether the lo op is on or off. You 
can set the start and end points of the loop in the LOOP window. 
02. Press the [WINDOW] button. 
The Loop window will be displayed as shown on the right. The MPC5000 will repeat the part you set in  the 'First Bar' and 'Last Bar' fields. 
If you set END in the 'Last Bar' field, the last bar of the sequence is always the end of the loop. Even if you edit a sequence  and change its length, 
the last bar of the sequence is still the end of the loop. 
The 'Total Bars' field displays the length of the bars to loop. The 'Last Bar' field and the Total Bars' field work together. C hanging the value in the 
'Last Bar' field also changes the value in the Number 'Total Bars' field. 
03. Press [F4] (CLOSE) button. 
This closes the window and goes back to MAIN page. 
 Extending the Sequence Length Automatically  
Usually, the length of a sequence is set based on the value of the 'Bars' field in the MAIN page. However, when you are 
recording or overdubbing with the 'Loop' fi eld set to OFF, the length of a sequence will be extended automatically. For 
example, when the 'Bars' field is set to 2, if you start recording with the 'loop' field set to OFF, the recording will 
continue after second bar until you press the [STOP] button.  And the number of the bar when you actually pressed the 
[STOP] button will be set as the new length for the sequence. This is useful when you do not know how long the part 
you are composing will continue. 
Tip: When you press the [PLAY START] button when the First ba r is not 1, the MPC5000 will start the playback from the 
bar set in the 'First Bar' field instea d of from the beginning of the sequence. 
 Changing the Default Settings  
Some settings for a sequence (such as number of the bars, time, tempo, and loop) are automatically set to the default setting when you create a new sequence. You can change the default settings for your convenience. 
01. In the MAIN page, set the 'Loop', 'Time Sig' and 'Bars' fields as 
you like. 
02. Select the 'Sequence' field and press the [WINDOW] button. 
The NAME SEQUENCE window will be displayed as shown. 
03. Press [F5] (USER) button. 
The USER DEFAULT window will be displayed as shown. 
04. Press [F5] (DO IT) button.

04. Press [F5] (DO IT) button. 
That deletes all sequences. Sequence numbers will displa y 'unused' as a name until  new data is recorded.  
 Handling the duration (the length of a note) at the loop boundary  
When you are recording a sequence in the loop mode, you can specify how the MPC5000 should operate when it 
reaches the boundary of the loop (it reaches the end of the sequence and jumps back to the beginning) while you are 
holding a pad. To set this, go to OTHER mode and select the 'Truncate Duration' Field. This setting allows you to choose how note lengths are handled at the 
end of the sequence.   
TO SEQ LENGTH 
The MPC5000 records a note as played up to sequence length.  In other 
words, if the sequence is two measur es long, the longest note that would 
be recorded will be 2 measures as well.   This is useful when a note is 
intended to cross from the end of the sequence to the beginning and still 
continue playing. 
TO SEQ END 
The MPC5000 cuts the note at the end of the sequence even if you hit 
the pad. You cannot record beyond the loop.  This is useful fo r making sure all notes end exac tly on the beat at the end of the  
sequence, and is useful for tightening up drum loops or long samples set to "NOTE ON" 
AS PLAYED 
The MPC5000 records your performance as it is played.  This is useful for when it's desirable to have a note play for a long ti me as a 
sequence loops.   
Track Features 
 Setting the Track Type  
You can set the track type in the 'Type' field in the MAIN page. There are two types of track: DRUM and MIDI. Below are 
the differences of each track type.  
DRUM  
Select this track type when you play  the MPC5000’s internal sampler by 
hitting pads. The DRUM track data will be managed per pad. 
MIDI  
Select this track type when you us e the MPC5000 as a MIDI sequencer 
with external MIDI devices (MIDI key board etc…). The MIDI track data is 
managed per MIDI note event. For mo re information, see 'MIDI 
Sequencer Features' section on Page 38. 
 Selecting a Program  
Playing Internal Programs 
In the 'Program:' field, select the internal program loaded in the internal memory by turning the [DATA] wheel. You can play th e 
selected program by hitting the pads. If you select 'OFF' or 'No.', the MPC5000 does not play the internal programs/samples. 



The Sequencer 34 
 
Playing an External Sound Module 
In the 'Program:' field, select 'OFF' or select a program number to play by choosing the 'Program Number' field (Displayed as ' No.') 
and select the desired program number. The MPC5000 will not play  an internal program, but instead will 'trigger' an external so und 
module such as a synth via MIDI. 
 Sending MIDI Program Changes  
When you select 'No.' in the 'Program:' field, the 'MIDI Program number' field will appear  in the right side of the 
'Program:' field. You can set the MIDI Program Number fro m 1 to 128. The selected MIDI Program Number will be 
transmitted from the selected MIDI OUT in 'MIDI' field when the sequence is selected or the [PLAY START] button is 
pressed. 
While selecting the 'No.' in the 'Program:' field, pressing the [WINDOW] button will open the 'Program Change' window. 
You can set a 'MIDI Bank Select' message to transmit together with a 
'MIDI Program Change' message in this window. You can also set whether a 'MIDI Program Change' me ssage recorded in the track is 
transmitted or not. 
Bank Select: (ON/OFF) 
Selects whether a 'Bank Select' message is transmitted or not. 
MSB: / LSB: (0-127) 
Sets the 'MSB' (Control Change # 0) and 'LSB' (Control Change #32) of 
a MIDI Bank Select message from 0 to 127. 
Transmit Program Changes in This Track 
Selects whether a 'MIDI Program Change' message recorded in the track is transmitted or not. 
Transmit Prog Change every loop 
Selects whether the sequence will send program change s whenever the sequence loops, or only on start. 
 Track Velocity  
Track Velocity allows you to adjust the Velo city ratio on the selected Track while the 
sequence is playing. 
Select the 'VELOCITY%:' field in the MAIN  page and adjust the Velocity ratio by 
turning the [DATA] wh eel from 1% to 200%. 
Note: Changing the 'VELOCITY%' has no effect while recording sequence data; it will only affect the playback of a 
sequence. If the velocity is set to 127 (maximum), any setting over 100% will have no effect. 
 Track Mute  
You can set the mute for each track independently. For example, let’s assume you 
have recorded a Piano solo on track 1 and another piano solo on track 2. By setting 
either track to mute, you can compare these two piano solos and choose the better one. If you set the mute ON for a track, the MPC5000 won’t play back that track. 
Tip: using TRACK MUTE, you can set the track mutes with a pad. For more information, see the 'Muting Sequence 
Tracks with Pads' section on Page 80. 
 Setting the MIDI Output Channel  
You can set the MIDI output channel for each track independently. 
You need to set the output channel when you use the MPC5000 to play an external 
MIDI sound module. You do not have to se t this when you are using the internal 
sampler. The MPC5000 has four MIDI outputs. Channels 1A through 16A will be sent out via 
MIDI OUT A, MIDI channels 1B through 16B will be sent out vi a MIDI OUT B, MIDI channels 1C through 16C will be sent 
out via MIDI OUT C, and MIDI channels 1D th rough 16D will be sent out via MIDI OUT D.

Pads D01-D16 Tracks 49-64 
 



 37 
 
Continuous Sample Tracks 
The MPC5000 plays samples assigned to pads when triggering the pad event. So that, if you have the sequence which 
has a long sample and start playing the sequence from a point which is past the actual pad event, the sample may not 
be played, because the pad event for the sample may be earlier than the sequen ce play start point.  
A Continuous Sample Track allows samples assigned to the selected Pad in each track to be played from their current 
position, whenever [PLAY] or [PLAY START] is pressed. This  way, if you are working with say, a four measure loop, 
pressing start at bar two will start the loop playing from its correct location at bar two immediately, without having to 
wait for a NOTE ON event. 
Tip: New to the MPC5000 is the ability to have up to 64 continuous sample tracks, each assigned to a specific pad. This 
allows you to have multiple loops, assigned to multiple tracks, usable with the TRACK MUTE function. For more 
information on Track Mute, see page 80. 
To enable 'Continuous Sample Trac k' on a selected track, do the 
following:  
01. In the MAIN mode, select the 'Track' field and press the 
[WINDOW] button. 
The TRACK NAME window will be displayed. 
02. Select the 'Continuous Sample Track' field, and select 'ON'. 
The 'Pad' field will be displayed below the 'Continuous Sample Track' field.  
03. Choose the pad you wish to have play continuously. 
The selected pad will play as a c ontinuous sample. Tracks set to Continuous will be displayed as a '+' in the 'Track Status' field. For more on the 
'Track Status' field, see page 22. 
 Selecting a Track with Function Keys  
You can quickly switch tracks using [F3] (TR -) button and [F4] (TR +) buttons. With [F3] (TR-) and [F4] (TR +) buttons, you can easily select a track without moving a cursor to the 'Track' field. 
 Soloing a Track   
When you are working on a sequence that has many tracks, it is useful to use the solo function to play back only the selected track. For example, when you are recording various instruments on several tracks, you can check the contents of each track with this feature. 
01. In the 'Track' field in the MAIN page, select a track you wish to play back. 
02. Press [F6] (SOLO) button and start re cording/playback of the sequence. 
The [F6] (SOLO) button will be highlighted and the MPC5000 plays back only the selected track and mutes all the other tracks. A ll Track 
Indicators  in the Track Status field in MAIN Mode will have an ‘x ’ except the select track, to indicate the SOLO feature is on .  For more 
information on the Track Status field, see page 22. 
03. To cancel the solo, press [F6] (SOLO) button again.

MIDI Sequencer Features  
When you are playing the internal sound module with the pa ds, you can start recording just by selecting the desired 
program in the 'Program' field in the MAIN page. Howeve r, the MPC5000 can be used as a MIDI sequencer. By 
connecting an external MIDI keyboard to it, you can record the data from the keyboard and control the external sound 
module. 
About MIDI... MIDI is a standard for transferring the performance data between electronic instruments regardless of the 
manufacturer. Devices are connected using a special cable called MIDI cable. For example, when you connect the 
keyboard’s MIDI OUT to MIDI IN of the MIDI sound module, the performance data you made with your keyboard will be 
sent to the MIDI sound module, which plays the sound. MIDI  can transfer only the performance data, not the actual 
sound. To transfer as much data as possible through one MIDI cable, there are MIDI channels. By using a MIDI channel, you can transfer different performance data  to each channel separately. You can transfer the performance data to up to 
16 channels. The MIDI channel is very  important when you handle MIDI. 
You must set the same MIDI channels for both the keyboard  and the sound module even if you play the sound from the 
keyboard. For example, if the keyboard’s output channel is set to 1, the sound module’s input channel should also be 1. 
Some sound modules can receive several channels. In that case, you can assign a separate instrument (Piano, Bass, 
Strings etc…) to each separate channel. 
About MIDI sequencers… A MIDI sequencer is a device that can record and play back  MIDI data. The MPC5000 can be used as a MIDI sequencer. 
When you connect an external MIDI keyboard to use the MPC5000 as a MIDI sequencer, connect the keyboard’s MIDI 
OUT to MPC5000’s MIDI IN, and the MPC5000’s MIDI OUT to th e external MIDI sound module’s MIDI IN. Thus, you can 
record the keyboard performance to the MPC5000 and play so unds from the MIDI sound module. In this section, you 
will learn how to record the performance data from the external MIDI keyboard to the MPC5000 and play sounds from 
the external sound module. 
01. Connect the external MIDI devices as described in the 'Using the MPC5000 with External Devices' section on 
Page 185. 
Connect the MIDI OUT of the keyboard to the MPC5000’s MIDI IN, and the MPC5000’s MIDI OU T to MIDI IN of the external sound modu le. 
Note: You may still want to connect the MPC5000’s stereo out to a mixer so that you can hear a metronome sound 
even when you use the MPC5000 as a MIDI sequencer. 
02. In the 'Type' field, select MIDI. 
03. In the 'Program' field, select OFF or No. 
If you select it to the OFF or No., the MPC5000 does not play inte rnal programs. If you select it  to the No. and set MIDI Progr am number, 
MPC5000 transmit the MIDI Program number to the external sound module for selecting the sound in  it when the sequence is select ed. 
04. In the 'MIDI' field, select a MIDI channel. 
Here, you set the MIDI channel to send the MIDI data on. Set the same channel as the one on the sound module. 
Tip: By default the MPC5000’s input MIDI ch annel is set to receive all MIDI channels, so you don’t have to set the 
channel to the keyboa rd’s MIDI channel. 
05. Play the keyboard to make su re the sound module works. 
If you don’t hear any sound, check the connection and make sure you have the correct settings for the keyboard and the sound mo dule. 
06. Press the [PLAY START] button while holding the [REC] button. 
The recording starts after 4 counts. 
07. Play the keyboard in time with the click sound. 
By default, sequence is set to 2 bars. After recording for 2 bar s, the MPC5000 will start playing back the recorded performance . If you make 
another performance with pads, you can add the performance to the currently recorded one. This is called 'overdub'. 
08. You can stop overdub by pressing the [STOP] button. 
09. Press the [PLAY] button to pl ay the recorded performance. 
10. If you don’t like the performance, you can start the new recording by pressing [REC] and [PLAY START]. 
This cancels the currently recorded perform ance data and starts the new recording. 
11. To add the recording to the already recorded data, press the [PLAY STAR T] button while holding [OVERDUB] 
button. 
This plays back the currently recorded performance and  you can add the new performance by hitting pads. 


 39 
Tip: If you select another sequence in the 'Sequence' field,  you can record a new performance separately. By playing 
back those sequences, you can create one whole song. 
Handling the Sustain Pedal 
In this section, you will learn how to handle sustain peda l information when you are using an external MIDI keyboard 
with the MPC5000 as a sequencer. 
Sustain pedal data is a MIDI event used to make the sound continue after a key on the keyboard is released. Usually a 
foot switch controls this data. The keyboard sends out Sustain pedal data as a separate event from a note event, so normally the sequencer recogniz es this data as separate data. However, wh en you are overdubbing on a short sequence 
loop, it might be better to convert the sustain pedal's data to the recorded note’s duration (the length of the note). For example, if you record the sustain pedal's data as it is, once  you press the sustain pedal during the loop, sustain will be 
applied to all the data after that. If you convert the sustain pedal's data to note duration , the movement of the sustain 
pedal will not affect the other notes. Thus, the MPC5000 is set to convert the sustain pedal's data to note duration by default, but you can change the setting to  record the data as sustain pedal data. 
12. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 9] (OTHER). 
This switches the MPC5000 to OTHER mode. 
13. Select the 'Sus Pedal to Duration' field.  
14. Use the [DATA] wheel to select one of the following choices for how the MPC5000 will interpret th e sustain pedal's MIDI data, 
depending on the desired behavior. 
YES 
The MPC5000 is set to convert the sustain pedal data to note duration. 
NO 
The MPC5000 records sustain pedal data as it is. 
 
Recording Aftertouch 
Aftertouch - also called Channel Pressure - is a specific co ntroller event, which is genera ted when a pad is triggered, 
and then pressure is varied by pressing heavier or lighte r. The pads on the MPC5000 are capable of sending aftertouch 
messages to both the MPC5000's internal synth, and to external devices via MIDI. Whether this aftertouch information is recorded or not can be selected by doing the following. 
01. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 9] (OTHER). 
This switches the MPC5000 to OTHER mode. 
02. Select the 'Record Aftertouch' field.  
03. Use the [DATA] wheel to select yes or no to decide if the MPC 
will record Aftertouch.  
 






 
 
Chapter 4:  Editing Sequences 
There are two ways to edit sequences. Using SEQ EDIT mode, you can edit entire regions of events at one time with 
one sweeping action. Using STEP EDIT and GRID EDIT mode, you can edit your sequences in finer detail, manipulating 
every event individually. In this section, you will learn ab out the SEQ EDIT mode, where you can edit entire regions at 
one time. SEQ EDIT Mode can be accessed by pressing the [MODE] button and then [PAD 12]. 
Selecting a region for the editing 
In the EVENTS page, there are six different editing options in the 'Edit' field: COPY, MOVE, TRANSPOSE, SHIFT TIME, 
VELOCITY, and DURATION. The procedure to select the editing region is the same for all six options. Let us begin with the selection of the editing region. 
Tips:  see page 25 for information on how to ERASE.  
 Setting the Range  
Select the 'Range' field in the EV ENTS page of the SEQ EDIT mode. 
In the 'Range' field, you can set the start and end points of the editing region. For example, to edit the firs t bar of a 2-bar sequence, set this 
field to '001.01.000 - 002.01.000'. In this case, the event at the '002.01.000' point will not be edited. 
If you set the end point '002.01.000', like in this picture, the area right 
before this point will be included in the area. 
 Setting the pad/note number  
01. Select the 'Pads' field in the EVENTS page of the SEQ EDIT mode. 
The display of the 'Pads' field depends on the type of the track that you have 
selected. 
When DRUM track is selected:  
By default, the field is set to ALL, which means the MPC5000 will edit all 
the pads. If you wish to edit only a s pecific pad, position the cursor in the 
'Pads' field and hit the desired pad. The pad number will be displayed in the 'Notes' field. You can select several pads. If you hit a different pad by mistake, you can cancel the selecti on by hitting the pad again. To restart 
the pad selection, turn the [DATA] w heel to the left. The value in the 
'Note' field will be reset to ALL so that you can select the pad that you want from the beginning. 
   
When MIDI track is selected:  
The display changes to show the selected region by note number. 
You will set the upper limit and the lower limit of the note in the field, The 
MPC5000 will edit only the events within the note numbers set in this field. 
 
 Copying events (COPY)  
You can copy events within the selected region to another pl ace. The source data will rema in in the original location.

will learn about the STEP EDIT mode, where you can edit each  event in detail. STEP EDIT mode is accessed by pressing 
[MODE]+[PAD13]. 
 A Note about Playing Events  
You can audition events while in STEP EDIT Mode by se lecting the event and pressing the [F6] (PLAY) button. 
 About Step Edit  
Each track has the performance data you made with pads or MIDI note information from an external MIDI keyboard. The Step Edit function allows you to edit each event separately, including individual note velocity, pitch, and duration, as well as MIDI controller data, program changes, and other types of 
events. There are also events specific to the MPC5000, such as Q-LINK controllers, pa d tuning and tempo. 
 'Now' field  
The 'Now' field is displayed in the upper left corner on the screen. The 'Now' field always displays the current position of a sequence. This is the same as the 'Now' field on the MAIN page. 
 Event List  
The event list is displayed below the 'Now' field and the 'View' field. This is where the events of a track are listed, their parameters, and at what time they each occur. This is where the editing of specific events is performed. 
Note: The sequencer of the MPC5000 divides the quarter note into 960 parts. These divisions are called ticks. 
 'View' field  
The 'View' field allows you to simplify the event list by settin g what is to be displayed. The event list will only display the  
events specified in this field. This is useful for customizing what's displayed, and filtering out unneeded events. 
 'Event Time' field  
The 'Event time' field is displayed on the left of the event list. It displays the positions of the events within the track. 
 Event  
The 'Event' field is displayed to the right of the 'Event time' field. The display will differ de pending on the type of event. 
You can change the value by moving the cursor to each parameter and adjusting the values with the [DATA] wheel. 
Numerical values can also be entered using the [NUMERIC KEYPAD]. 
Basic operation 
 Event List  
When the cursor is in the 'Now' field or 'View' field, pressi ng the down [cursor] will move the cursor to the event list. 
This is where the events in the track are listed. You can se lect the events with up/down [cursor] buttons and the field 
with the right/left [CURSOR]  buttons. You can change the value in the field by turning the [DATA] wheel. 
In the event list, you can select several events at one time  by pressing the down [CURSO R] while holding the [SHIFT] 
button.

Events 
 Pad Event  
This is the event that is recorded when you hit the pads in the DRUM track. 
'P (pad)' field 
You can set the pad number in this field. 
'Note Variation' field 
In the above picture, the area that displays 'T' is the 'Note 
Variation' field. You can select the type of note variation data to 
record with the Q-LINK sliders. 
 
T Tune (pitch) 
F Filter 
L Layer A Attack time 
D Decay time 
P Pan Q Resonance V Level R Release X Effect Send 
 
Tip: Note variation data, which is used for the Q-LINK sliders or [16 LEVELS] function, is the information used to control 
the sound of a pad, and is saved in the track along with the pad event. With the note variation data, you can switch the 
sounds of the pad even when you are playing back the same pad. 
'Note variation value' field 
In this field, displayed to the right of the 'Note Va riation' field, you can set the note variation value. 
'D (duration)' field 
Here, you can set the duration of notes and pad events. This param eter determines how long the pad or MIDI note is held. The va lue 
is displayed in MIDI Ticks. 
'V (velocity)' field 
Here, you can set the velocity of a pad. Velocity is a measure of how hard the pad was hit. The velocity is shown in 127 steps,  with 
127 the maximum. This can be used to play s ounds softer, louder, or control the filter  cutoff etc. For more information on velo city, see 
'Note Number, Velocity, and Length' on page 15. 
 
 Note Event  
This is a MIDI note event.  
'N (Note number)' field 
You can set the note number in this field. A note number indica tes the location on a keyboard as a numbers, with the middle C o f the 
piano as note number 60. 
'D (duration)' field 
You can specify how long a note is held (length of a note). In t he MIDI standard, pressing a key is called 'Note on', releasing  a key is 
called 'Note off'. In this field, you will se t the time from Note on to Note off. 



 49 
'V (velocity)' field 
You can set the velocity of the note even t. In the MIDI standard, the speed used to trigger a note is called velocity. The velo city is 
shown in 127 steps, with 127 the maximum. 
 Pitch Bend Event  
You can set the pitch bend. Normally this event is used to control the pitch in real time. 
 Control Change Event  
The control change, which is used for various applications, is the most versatile 
event in the MIDI standard. The control change event consis ts of a control number, which determines the type of the 
control change, and the control change value. 
'CC' field  
You can select the type of the control change in this field,  and the control change value in the field on the right.  
 Program Change Event  
You can set the program change. This event is normally used to switch the sound of an 
external sound module. If program numbers are assigned to programs in the internal sampler section, you can switch 
the programs that are assigned to the track within the sequence. 
 Channel Pressure Event  
You can set the channel pressure. Normally, a Channel pressure event is used for aftertouch. This feature al lows you to control the sound depending on the pressure used to press the keyboard. 
 Poly Pressure Event  
The Poly pressure event is used for aftertouch much like the channel pressure event, however the Poly pressure event ca n be set to different values for each individual note. 
 Exclusive Data Event   
System Exclusive events are used by different  manufactures to control a specific devices 
non-standard functions such as different program parameters, or to send preset ed iting data, tuning information, and so 
forth. These commands are most typically device specific, and not able to be edited using standard MIDI CC#s. The MPC5000 can edit exclusive data in addition to record and play them back. To learn what data is required for each of your devices, please consult the devices user manual. 
 Editing the exclusive data  
To Edit an EXCLUSIVE Event, select the field as shown on the right and press the [WINDOW] button.  
     The data of each byte will be displayed. You can scroll through the 
display with right/left cu rsor buttons. Select the byte that needs change, 
and change the setting with the DATA wheel or the -/= buttons.  
To change the length of the exclusive data, press the [F2] (F7 EOX) key. 
Pressing the [F2] (F7 EOX) key enters “F7”, which indicates the end of the exclusive data, to the selected byte. Pressing the [F5] (SEND) key 
sends out the currently set exclusive data. When you finish editing, press the [F4] (CLOSE) key and close the window.  
To send the Exclusive data to your device, press the [F5] (SEND) button.

 Effect Select Event  
This event is used to switch the effect sets within the sequence.  
 Tempo Change Event  
Tempo change event is used to change the tempo within the sequence.  
The tempo change event is different  from other events. It does not 
belong to a specific track. By selecting TEMPO in the 'View' field, you can display the tempo change event information 
separately, regardless of the selected tr ack. Even when you have selected ALL EVENTS in the 'View' field, the tempo 
change event will not be displayed in the event list. 
'%' field 
You can set the amount of the tempo change.  
Current / New Tempo

a b o v e .  T h i s  a l l o w s  f o r  e a s y  e d i t i n g  o f  ' D R U M '  t y p e  t r a c k s  i n  a  m a t r i x  display.  
   
 MIDI View  
When the current track 'TYPE' is set to 'MIDI' on the main page (See 
page 21), the track will be displayed in a 'Piano Roll' style as above. This allows for easy editing of 'MIDI' type tracks in a matrix display. This view is useful to also see the duration of each note played.  
Which octave is being viewed can be selected by changing the field on 
the right of the screen.  Both of these views share the following parameters: 
 
 Now 
The 'Now' field is displayed in the upper left corner on the scr een. The 'Now' field always displays the current position of 
a sequence. This is the same as the 'Now' field 
on the MAIN page. 
 Time ruler  
This indicates the time axis of the track. The number in the ruler shows the bar number. 
 Vertical marker  
This indicates the current location. You can use it to select the editing region on the time ruler. 
 Horizontal marker

GRID EDIT Mode 56 
Basic operation 
 Operation in the Event area  
When the cursor is in the 'Now' field, pressing the down curs or button moves the cursor to the Event area. The cursor in 
the Event area is at the grid where the vertical and horizontal  markers intersect. Your editing operations will be affected 
in the selected grid. 
You can move the cursor in the Event area by the cursor butt ons. You can also move the curs or to horizontal directions 
by turning the [DATA] wheel. If the Event area is not shown in the grid, the time ruler will move and the next event area will be shown by turning the 
[DATA] wheel. 
When the horizontal marker is the upper side of the Event ar ea, pressing the up cursor button will move the cursor to 
the 'Now' field. 
 Relationship of Grid Value to Timing Correct.  
The unit of the grid in the Event area is changed by the Note value in the Timing Correct window which is shown by 
pressing the [F1] (T.C.) button. When you set the Note value to 1/16, one unit of the grid is 1/16 notes. When you set the Note value to 1/8, one unit 
of the grid is set to 1/8 notes. 
Example: First, the Note value has been set to 1/32 an d the Pad Events are recorded as in the drawing below 
  
If you change the Note value to 1/16, the even area will be changed as follows. 
  
In this case, every single event is displayed in the first four grids but each grid actually has two Pad Events. 
When you edit (such as copy/paste/delete/move) th e grid, all the events in the grid are edited. 
Note: If you only wish to change how the units are displayed in the grid, press the [F4] (CLOSE) button after changing 
the Note Value in Timing Correct window. If you press the [F5] (FIX), the MPC50000 will begin processing the Timing 
Correct change. 
 Selecting an event  
When you select the Pad Event, move the cursor to the grid of the Pad Event by pressing the cursor buttons. For example, if you wish to select the PAD A03 event at 0 01.04.00 in the display, press the right cursor button several 
times (or turn the [DATA] wheel) and move the cursor to th e position of 001.04.00. The vertical marker moves and the 
display in the 'Now' field becomes to '001.04.000'. Next, move the cursor to the PAD A03 row by pressing the down 
cursor button. The display will looks like this. 
The event will now be displayed as a white '
' symbol within the Now Time marker. Now 
the event in the grid is selected. 
In the Event area, you can select several pads and region s by pressing the [SHIFT] button and moving the cursor 
button. When the cursor is in the event area, pressing the [WINDOW] button will 
display the 'Events' window. The selected Pad Events are displayed in this window. If you select several grids, all the Pad Events in the grid will be displayed.  
'Tick' field (left side) 
This shows the tick value of the Event. It cannot be edited. 
'P' (pad) or 'N' (note) field 
You can select the Pad Number or Note in this field 
In the above picture, the area that displa ys 'T' is the 'Note Variation' field. 
You can select the type of note variation. 



 57 
Tip: Note variation data, which is used for the Q-LINK sliders or [16 LEVELS] function, is the information used to control 
the sound of a pad, and is saved in the track along with the pad event. With the note variation data, you can switch the 
sounds of the pad even when you are playing back the same pa d. See STEP EDIT mode on page 47 for more info on the 
various Note Variation parameters. 
'Note Variation Value' field 
In this field, displayed to the right of the 'Note Vari ation' field, you can select the Note Variation Value.

 Chapter 8:  HD RECORD Mode 
Another function that is new to MPC line with the MPC5000 is Hard Disk Recording. Using the [RECORD IN], [PHONO

keyboards -just about anything you can imagine – to your song. Up to eight tracks can be recorded per song.  
Since this audio is recorded directly to the Hard Drive, no RAM is used, so the only limit to how much you can record is the size of the Hard Drive. Many hours of sound can be recorded on the MPC5000's Hard Drive. You can also apply effects to your Hard Disk tracks, edit your recorded audio, and mix down your song along with your song to create a finished product.

Chapter 9:  Functions of a Pad 
The MPC5000 has 16 drum pads. The pads perform various functi on besides making sounds when hit. In this section, 
you will learn about various functions of the pad.  
Playing with pads 
By assigning the sounds in memory to a pad, you can play those 
sounds. 
Below are some useful functi ons when playing with pads. 
 Switching pad banks  
The MPC5000 has 16 pads, but you can play up to 64 samples by 
switching between the four pad banks. 
The LED of the currently selected pad bank (from banks A 
through D) is turned on. By pressing the desired [PAD BANK] button, you can switch pad banks. 
 Full level function ([FULL LEVEL] button)  
You can control the level of the so und by the velocity used to hit 
the pads, but if you press the [F ULL LEVEL] button, the MPC5000 
will play the sample at the maximum level regardless of the velocity. 
If you press the [FULL LEVEL] button, the LED will be lit, and the 
full level function will be activated. To deactivate this function, press the [FULL LEVEL] button again. 
 16 levels function ([16 LEVEL] button)  
You can play a sound using 16 parameter levels assigned to the 16 pads. 
01. Hit the pad that you wish to play in 16 levels. 
02. Press the [16 LEVELS] button. 
The Assign 16 Levels window will be displayed. 
The 'Pad' field displays the pad you selected in step 1. 
03. In the 'Type' field, select the type of the parameter that you 
wish to play in 16 levels. 
You can select the following parameters; 
VELOCITY 
The MPC5000 will play the velocity in 16 levels. 
TUNE 
The MPC5000 will play a single pad in a sample program by varying pitch in 16 levels by semitone. 
FILTER 
The MPC5000 will play the filter cutoff value in 16 levels. 
LAYER 
The MPC5000 will play the layer value in 16 levels. 
DECAY 
The MPC5000 will play the decay value in 16 levels. 
ATTACK  
The MPC5000 will play the attack value in 16 levels. 
When TUNE is selected, the Original key 'Pad' field will be disp layed. In this field, you can specify the pad that plays the or iginal key pad. 
04. Press the [F5] (TurnON) button. 


Functions of a Pad 80 
The window closes and the LED of the [16 LEVELS] button is turned on, which indicates you can play in 16 levels. Pressing the [ 16 LEVELS] 
button turns its LED off and deacti vates the 16 levels function. 
Tip: When you select VELOCITY in the 'Type' field, the velocity of the pad event can be played in 16 levels, but if you 
select an option other than VELOCITY, the note variation value will be played in 16 levels. The note variation data can 
change the value of a specific parameter when you play the pa d’s sample. For example, if you select TUNE in the 'Type' 
field, when you hit the pad, the note variation data of TUNE  will be sent to the sampler section with the pad event, and 
the TUNE value will be changed according to the pad you played. 
During Sequence recording, the Note variation data will be recorded with the note event and you can play back the sequence exac tly what was 
played. The note variation value is also used for the Q- Link slider function.  
Muting Sequence Tracks with Pads (Track Mute) 
You can mute/unmute sequencer tracks in real time during pl ayback by hitting the pads. This is useful when you have 
several instruments assigned to differen t tracks, so that you can play a song and switch tracks on/off using the pads 
while playing back your sequence. 
01. Press the [TRACK MUTE] button 
02. Press [F1] (TkMUTE) 
This brings up the Track Mute page. 
'Now' field 
Like the 'Now' field in the MAIN page, this field displays the current time 
position of the sequence. 
'Sequence' field 
Like the 'Sequence' field in the MAIN page, you can select a sequence in this field. 
Track list 
The track list is displayed under the 'Now' field and the 'Sequence' field. 
The track list displays the first 8 letters of the track na me. The tracks are displayed according to the position of 
the pads; Track 1 on the lower left and track 16 on the upper right. You can display 16 pads at one time, but 
you can display 1 to 64 tracks by switching pad banks.  The track whose track mute is set to off will be 
highlighted. 
 Operation  
Hitting a pad when the track mute page is displayed switches the track mute setting of that track instead of playing the 
sound. 
 Solo Function  
With the Solo function, you can play back only the selected track. 
01. Hit the pad that corresponds to the track that you wish to play, while pressing the [F6] (SOLO) button. 
[F6] (SOLO) will be highlighted and MPC5000 will play only the se lected track while it mutes the other tracks. You can switch the tracks to play, 
by hitting a pad. 
02. Pressing [F6] (SOLO) deactivates the solo function. 
 Selecting Instant Track Mute  
The MP5000 has the ability to mute tracks using two different methods. Method one ignore Note On messages. This is 
how legacy MPC track muting has worked . This method allows samples and notes that are playing to finish playing 
through their entire length. This is useful  when using loops, and you want to have a loop finish playing to the end of a 
measure, then not play the next time the sequence loops.  Method two is Instant Track Muting, which sends MIDI trac k volume. This is a method that is new to the MPC5000, 
which is useful for when you want to have the track muted im mediately. The advantage of this method is that the loop 
will continue to play, but at zero volume, allowing the loop to continue playing when the track is unmuted. Using this 
method, stuttering, beat juggling between two loops,  and other DJ style techniques can be employed.  
 



 81 
To Turn on Instant Track Mute, do the following:  
01. From the MAIN page, select the 'MUTE' field. 
02. Press [WINDOW] 
The MUTE EVENTS window will be displayed.

option. 
ON 
Tracks will be muted instantly by sending MIDI Volume.  
OFF 
Tracks will be muted like legacy MPCs , by ignoring Note Off events.  
 Setting the Track Mute in Solo Mode  
Solo function switches the track mute setting temporarily. Turning off the solo function resets the track mute settings for each track to the same status as before the solo functi on was activated. However, you can also turn off the solo 
function while keeping the track mute setting unchanged. With this feature, you can make a performance starting with many tracks followed by only a simple rh ythm track and then gradually add tracks. 
Operation 
When the solo function is on, press [F6] (SOLO) while holding the [SHIFT] button. 
The Solo function will be deactivated and the mute setting for t he track set to solo will be turned off. The setting for other tracks will be 
turned on.  
 Recording Track Mutes

The MPC5000 has 8 outputs (assignable mix out) as well as the stereo out. Entire tracks of a sequence can be sent out 
of these outputs. Additionally, Sample Programs can have th eir individual pads sent out of any one of these outputs 
individually, as a mono signal or a stereo pair. Here, we will discuss setting the outputs of a Sample Program's specific 
pads. This will allow you to send out individual pads to an external source, such as an effects processor, mixer, or a recording device.  
Tip: Each track's settings can be viewed in detail by selecting the track and pressing [WINDOW].

Chapter 11:  Sampling 
In this chapter, you will learn how to record from an anal og external device (CD player’s analog output, microphone, 
etc…) so that you can play that sound by hitting a pad. 
Preparing the recording 
01. Connect the external device to [RECORD IN], which is located on the MPC5000’s rear panel. 
The MPC5000 can accept audio input from its 1/4 inch / MIC combo jacks, as well the RCA and Digital inputs . Any of these connec tions will work 
for recording. 
Note: Make sure to set the [LINE/MIC] and [LINE/PHONO] swit ches appropriately for your source. Incorrect setting of 
this switch can produce distortion.  
02. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 4] (REC SAMPLE). 
When you press the [MODE] button, its LED will blink. Pressing [PAD 4] with the 
[MODE] button’s LED on displays the SAMPLE page, where you adjust the setting 
for the recording. 
03. Select the 'Input' field, and select the recording source. For this 
example, please select ANALOG. 
The following sources are available as well: 
ANALOG 
The MPC5000 will record the incoming signal from the RECORD IN on 
the rear panel. 
PHONO 
The MPC5000 will record through the PHONO inputs. This in put is useful for devices with RCA-type connections. 
DIGITAL 
The MPC5000 will record the incoming signal from the DIGITAL IN on the rear panel. 
MAIN OUT 
The MPC5000 will record the same signal as the signal from the [STEREO OUT] on the rear panel. 
OUT 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 
The MPC5000 will record the same signal as the si gnal from the selected [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT].  
INT CD 
The MPC5000 will record the signal from Audio CD in internal CD drive. (This only can be selected if the optional CD drive is 
installed.) 
04. Select the 'Mode' field and select 'STEREO' or 'MONO'. 
STEREO 
The MPC5000 will record the left and right channel signals as a stereo sample. 
MONO L 
The MPC5000 will record only the left channel signal. 
MONO R 
The MPC5000 will record only the right channel signal. 
05. Play the source. Check the level meter on screen and adjust the recording level using the [REC GAIN] knob. 
Note: When you select DIGITAL, MAIN OUT, one of the Assignable OUT pairs, or CD in the 'Input' field, you cannot 
adjust the recording level with the [REC GAIN] knob. 
The level meter moves according to the input level. If the mete r goes too far to the right, th e sound will be distorted, but if  the sound level is too 
low, the sample will gain a lot of noise. Set the level as high as possible without reaching the right edge (clip). 
06. Select the 'Threshold' field and set the threshold level to start 
the recording. 
When the MPC5000 is in record enable mode,  it starts the recording automatically 
when the level of the incoming source exc eeds the threshold level. If you set the 
threshold level too high, the MPC5000 ma y not start the recording when you play 
the input source, or the beginning of the recording may be missing. If you set the 
threshold level too low, the MPC5000 may start the recording before you play the 
external source. Set this to the appropriate level using the level meter. The threshold level will be indicated as sh own in the figure to the right.  


Sampling 96 
07. Select the 'Time' field an d set the recording time.

Sampling - detailed information 
In this section, you will learn about several features regarding the recording which were not described in the previous 
section. 
Recording the digital signal  
Here, you will learn how to record a digital signal. 
Note: You can record only from the devices whose sampling rate s are set to either 44.1 kHz (ex. CD player) or 48 kHz 
(ex. DAT). The MPC5000 does not support the other sampling rates. 
 Preparing the recording  
01. Connect the external device to the DIGITAL IN which is located on the MPC5000’s rear panel. 
02. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 4]  (REC SAMPLE) to display the SAMPLE page. 
03. Select the 'Input' field and select DIGITAL.  
04. Select the 'Mode' field an d select STEREO or MONO. 
05. Play the source. Check the level meter on screen. 
Note: With the digital recording, you ca nnot adjust the recording level. 
06. Select the 'Threshold' field and set the threshold level to trigger the recording. 
07. Select the 'Time' field an d set the recording time. 
For the next steps, proceed as described in th e 'Starting the recording' section on page 96. 
Recording the MAIN OUT 
In this section, you will learn how to record the same signal from the STEREO OUT of the MPC5000. With this feature, you can add the effects to the recorded sample and resample it, or you can record the phrase that you created with the 
sequence feature, as one sample. 
 Preparation For Recording  
01. Prepare the system so that you can play the desired so und by hitting the pads or playing back the sequence. 
The sound that the MPC5000 will actually record is exactly the same as the sound from the [STEREO OUT]. Before going back to SA MPLE 
mode, set the program and sequence so that the desired sound will be output from the [STEREO OUT]. 
02. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 4]  (REC SAMPLE) to display the SAMPLE page. 
03. Select the 'Input' field and select MAIN OUT. 
04. Select the 'Mode' field an d select STEREO or MONO. 
05. Select the 'Time' field an d set the recording time. 
Note: When the MAIN OUT is selected, the recording level is decided by the setting of Master level in OTHER mode. The 
initial setting of the Master level is –12dB as the output sound will not distort when many samples are played back 
simultaneously. If you record one sample through MAIN OUT with this setting, the recorded sample level is lower than 
the original sample level. In this case, if you set the Mast er level to 0dB, the recorded sample level is same as the 
original sample level. 
For the next steps, proceed as described in th e 'Starting the recording' section on page 96. 
Recording the internal CD’s sound 
In this section, you will learn how to record the CD’s sound from the internal CD drive directly to the MPC5000. (When the optional internal CD drive is installed.) 
 Preparation For Recording  
01. Set the audio CD you wish to record on the tray of the internal CD drive. 
02. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 4] (REC SAMPLE) to display the SAMPLE page

Hint: In the LOAD page, you can load a track from the audio CD into the internal memory. For more information, see 
'Saving and Loading (DISK Mode)' on page 165. 
Other Features 
 Monitoring feature  
In the 'Monitor' field of the SAMPLE page, you can determine if you want to monitor the input signal (output the signal 
from the STEREO OUT) in SAMPLE mode or not. 
ON 
You can monitor the input signal. This is useful when you record sounds directly from the CD player. 
OFF 
You cannot monitor the input signal. For ex ample: when you send the signal to the MP C5000 through a mixer, both the source soun d 
and the monitored sound may be sent to the mixer.  To avoid this, you should set this to OFF. 
 Peak hold/Reset peak feature  
The level meter in the SAMPLE page has the peak hold feature. This is a useful feature for adjusting the signal level during recording. Normally, the display of the level meter changes in real time according to the level of the incoming signal. However, the peak hold displays the maximum level and keeps the level, even when the level decreases. 
To reset the peak hold display, press the [F1] or [F2] (RES ET PEAK) button in the SAMPLE page.

 RECORD INFORMATION Window  
Important information on your record ing can be accessed while in REC 
SAMPLE Mode via the RECORD INFORMATION Window. To access the 
RECORD INFORMATION Window, press the [WINDOW] button while in REC SAMPLE Mode.  
The following information and para meters can be accessed here.  
Pre Record Time 
To avoid clicks / pops or errors when recording, the MPC5000 can 
cache the beginning of the recordin g. When the recording starts, the 
cache is added to the beginning of the sample.  
For example, if you are recording from CD, and you press the (F6)  [RECORD] button to start recording at 3 minutes, sample will 
contain data starting from 2:59. This param eter will allow for up to one second of recording time to be cached. This is great f or 
sampling "on the fly" to make sure the beginning of, for example, a bass hit isn’t cut off when recording live.  
Largest recording (time) 
This shows the largest amount of time a single recording can be.  This is especially useful w hen the 192MB expansion is installe d. The 
EXM-E3 adds a second chunk of 128MB of sample recording time, wh ich totals 192 when combined with the built in RAM. This allows  
a sample totaling 128MB in size, or over 24 minut es of mono sampling time for a single sample.  
Total free memory (time) 
This field displays how much recording time is left in RAM. Th is will also tell you how much RAM is installed in your unit.  
Direct Recording feature 
Recording a live performance while listening to a sequence 
 Preparing the recording  
01. Connect the external device to the RECORD IN, which is located on the MPC5000’s rear panel. 
02. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 4] (REC SAMPLE). 
03. Select the 'Input' field, and th en select the recording source. 
ANALOG 
The MPC5000 will record the incoming signal from the RECORD IN on the rear panel. 
DIGITAL 
The MPC5000 will record the incoming signal from the DIGITAL IN on the rear panel. 
In Direct Recording, the MAIN OUT/CD are not av ailable. For this example, please select ANALOG. 
04. In the 'Mode' field, select STEREO or MONO. 
05. In the 'Monitor' field, select 'ON'. 
If you set the Monitor' field to 'ON', you can hea r your performance from the OUTPUT of the MPC5000. 
06. Play your instrument and check the level meter. You can adjust the recording level using the [REC GAIN] knob. 
Note: When you select DIGITAL in the 'Input' field, you cannot adjust the recording level with the [REC GAIN] knob. 
The level meter moves according to the input level. If the meter goes too far to the right, the sound will be distorted, 
but if the sound level is too low, the sample will gain a lot of noise. Set the level as high as possible without reaching 
the right edge (clip) 
Note: In Direct recording, the threshold / 'Time' fields are not available. 
Note: In Direct recording, the MPC5000 keeps recording to  the maximum time of the free memory and stops the 
recording when you press the [STO P] button. Setting the 'Time' fields will have no effect. 
The Direct Recording feature will allow you to record a sign al from 'RECORD IN' while the sequence is playing back. This 
makes it much easier to ensure the sample yo u record will match the Tempo of the sequence. 
Because a sample by Direct Recording is recorded to the internal RAM memory, the recording time is dependent upon 
the internal memory capacity.

Chapter 12:  Sample Editing: TRIM Mode 
 
Setting the Start / End Points 
The start/end points set the part of th e sample data which will be played. 
The recorded sample may - for example - have silence at the beginning, 
which may make it more difficult to place the sound in the correct spot when hitting the pad. You can fix this by adjusting the start point. You can also adjust both the start and end points to play only a part of the 
phrase. If the sample has extra silence or unwanted sound at the end, you can delete the empty parts by adjusting the end point and using the 
edit feature. This is a good way to free up additional memory.  
Start/end points are displayed in sample points. The sample point is the 
minimum unit used for sample editing. The MPC5000 has 44,100 sample points per second.  
 About the waveform display

05. In the 'New' field, set the desired new tempo. 
Tip: If you want to change the sample length with %, you ca n use the following method. Fo r example, if you wish to 
lengthen the sample by 20%, you set the original tempo to 100, then set the new tempo to 120. Now you can get the 
20% longer sample. 
06. Set the 'Preset' field and 'Adjust' fields if necessary. 
Preset: 
The MPC5000 uses 18 preset algorithms to carr y out the timestretch process, so you can select a preset that nearest resembles y our 
sample’s content. If the results are not to your liking, try experimenting with different presets. Each preset is divided into A, B or C: 
A: Standard quality timestretch with fast processing. 
B: Better quality timestretch with slower processing. C: Highest quality timestretch with even slower processing. 
Time stretch Presets: 
01. FEM VOX (Female Voice) 02. MALE VOX (Male Voice) 03. LOW MALE VOX (Low Male Voice)

18. SLOW ORCH. (Slow Orchestra) 
Adjust 
You can use this to ‘tweak ’ the selected preset. If your sele cted preset is close to what you’ re looking for, but still needs a  little fine 
tuning, try a few different settings here until you get the best result. A ( + ) value will help improve high frequency and per cussive 
sounds while a ( - ) value will help improve bass sound. Most of the time, this can be left at zero. 
07. Press [F5] (DO IT). 
It may take some time to process depending on the length of the sample. 
The Keep or Retry window will be displayed after executing the timestretch.

If you enter +12.00, the sample will pitch up one octave. 
05. Set the 'Preset' field and 'Adjust' fields if necessary. 
Preset 
The MPC5000 uses 18 preset algorithms to carry  out the pitch shift process, so you should select a preset that closely resemble s your 
sample’s content. If you are not happy with the results, try experimenting with different presets. 
A: Standard quality pitch shift with fast processing. B: Better quality pitch shif t with slower processing. 
C: Highest quality pitch shift with even slower processing. 
Time stretch Presets: 
01. FEM VOX (Female Voice) 
02. MALE VOX (Male Voice) 
03. LOW MALE VOX (Low Male Voice) 04. VOCAL 05. HFREQ RHYTHM (High Frequency Rhythm Section) 06. MFREQ RHYTHM (Middle Frequency Rhythm Section) 07. LFREQ RHYTHM (Low Fr equency Rhythm Section) 
08. PERCUSSION 09. LFREQ PERC. (Low Frequency Percussion) 10. STACCATO 11. LFREQ SLOW (Low Frequency Slow Music) 12. MUSIC 1 13. MUSIC 2 14. MUSIC 3 
15. SOFT PERC. (Soft Percussion) 
16. HFREQ ORCH. (High Frequency Orchestra) 17. LFREQ ORCH. (Low Frequency Orchestra) 18. SLOW ORCH. (Slow Orchestra) 
Adjust 
You can use this to ‘tweak ’ the selected preset. If your sele cted preset is close to what you’ re looking for, but still needs a  little fine 
tuning, try a few different settings here until you get the best result. A ( + ) value will help improve high frequency and per cussive 
sounds while a ( - ) value will help improve bass sound. Most of the time, this can be left at zero. 
 
06. Press [F5] (DO IT). 
The Keep or Retry window will be displayed after executing the Pitch shift. 
Lengthy samples will take longer to process. 
'New name' field:

 Gain 
This function allows the volume of a sample to be raised or lowered by up 
to 18dB. Note that this function is different than Normalization in that it will allow volume to be boosted beyond  the point of clipping. This may be 
a desired effect, but be sure to  watch your output levels!  
Gain Amount 
This field sets how much the volume  is to be boosted. This parameter 
can be set to a maximum of +/- 18dB.  
[F4] (CANCEL) / [F5] (DO IT) 
Press [F4] (CANCEL) to abort the GAIN  operation. Press [F5] (DO IT) to 
apply the change.  
 Bit Reduce  
The Bit Reducer removes bits from a sample, effectively lowering the 
quality of the sample. Using the Bit Reducer can be effective at achieving a "dirty" sound on drum loops, without the harshness of distortion. This is similar in sound to the Resampler effect, but permanently applies the change to the sample.  
Bit Depth 
This field sets the amount that the Bit Reducer will reduce the source 
material to. This ranges in sound from a Vintage Sampler sound (12 bits), to an aliased, dirty sound as sociated with some popular vintage 
home computers (8 bit), to a full on digital sound, akin to some very popular 80s game consoles (4 bit).  
[F4] (CANCEL) / [F5] (DO IT) 
Press [F4] (CANCEL) to abort the Bit Reduce oper ation. Press [F5] (DO IT) to apply the change.  
 Fade In  
This function sets an automatic fade in between the in and out point of 
the selected section. The following fade types are available: 
 
Linear Fade In  
This selection fades in the audio 
with a linear curve. A linear curve will go from start to end with no 
curve, creating a straight line. 
 
 Logarithmic Fade In  
This selection fades in the audio 
with a Logarithmic curve. A logarithmic curve will quickly rise, and then even out for the middle 
section, surging quickly again as it 
nears the end. 
 
 Exponential Fade In 
This selection fades the audio with an Exponential curve. An exponential curve will slowly rise in the beginning, and then quickly rise 
for the middle section, and then 
slowing again as it nears the end. 
 
[F4] (CANCEL) / [F5] (DO IT) 
Press [F4] (CANCEL) to abort the Fade In opera tion. Press [F5] (DO IT ) to apply the change.

Dividing a Phrase Sample into Several Regions 
 Chop Shop  
The Chop Shop function will allow you to divide a phrase sample into 
several regions. The MPC5000 has two different ways to use the Chop Shop function. 'AUTO', whic h divides a sample into several 
regions, automatically detecting the attack part of the phrase in the 
sample, and 'EQUALLY' which divides a sample to several regions of equal length. 
 SLICED SAMPLE/PATCHED PHRASE  
The divided sample, whether 'AUTO' or 'EQUALLY', can be used the following two ways. 'SLICED SAMPLES' will assign each divided region to a pad, or as a 'PATCH ED PHRASE', which is one sample 
which has the divided regions and the sequence data for playing the divided regions in time. You can change the tempo freely when playing the sequence. 
Note: Chop Shop works on both stereo and mono files.

 Note On vs. One Shot  
When you play a sample by hitting the pad,  the sample will be played to the end. This is useful when you want to play 
short drum sounds. However, when you play a long sample such as a phrase sample, it is better to set the MPC5000 to 
play the sample only while you hold the pad. In this section,  you will learn how to play the sample only as long as the 
pad is pressed. 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mode, hit the pad you wish to 
change. 
The pad number display in the left of t he screen will change according to the pad 
that you hit.  
02. Select the '1' field, and press the [WINDOW] button.  
The PLAY MODE window will be displayed.  
03. In the '1' field select one of the following: 
ONE SHOT  
The MPC5000 plays the sample until the end regardless of how long 
you hold the pad. 
NOTE ON  
The MPC5000 plays the sample only while you hold the pad. 
04. Select fields '2' - '4' to adjust each sa mple assigned to the pad individually.  
Note: When you loop the sample, set the play mode to NOTE ON. When you select ONE SHOT, a sample will NOT loop, 
even when the sample's loop is set to ON.  
 Volume and Tuning For a Sample  
You can set volume and tuning for sa mples that are assigned to a pad. 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mo de, hit the pad you wish to edit. 
The pad number display in the left of the screen will change according to the pad 
you hit. 
02. Select the 'Lvl' field.  
03. Adjust the volume to the desired level. 
You can audition the level changes by hitting the pad as you set the level. 
04. Select the 'Tune' field. 
The 'Tune' field has two fields divided by a decimal point.  
The 2 digits on the left set tuning by semitones. The 2 digits on the right change the tuning by cents (100 cents = 1 semitone). 
05. Set the tune to the desired pitch offset.  
You can audition the tune changes by hitting the pad as you adjust the pitch. 
 Velocity  
You can control the sample volume by velo city (how hard you hit the pad). With this feature, you can play the pads like 
real drums; when you hit the pad strongly , the sound will be loud and vice versa. 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mo de, hit the pad you wish to edit. 
The pad number display in the left of the screen will change according to the pad 
you hit. 
02. Press the F5 softbutton (AmpEnv). 
The Amp Envelope window will be displayed.  This window is also available by selecting the LVL Field and pressing the [WINDOW] Button.   
03. Select the 'V>Level' field. 



 121 
04. Adjust the field to the desired value while ch ecking the level by hitting the desired pad. 
If you set this field to 0, the sample will be played back at the maximum level regardless of the amount of pressure. The larger you set the value, 
the bigger the difference of the level will be. 
05. Press [F4] (CLOSE) to return to the Sample page. 
You can set more detailed settings for sample volume by using the other parameters in the Amp Envelope window. For more information about 
setting them, see the section entitled 'Amplitude Envelope' on page 123. 
Velocity / Cycle / Random Sample Switching (Zone Play)  
Samples assigned to the pads can be switched to play in three different ways, depending on your desired play mode.  
 Velocity Sample Switching  
When you assign more than one sample to a pad, you can switch between 
samples by how hard you hit the pad. 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mode, select the desired pad by 
hitting it. 
02. Assign the samples to the '1' field and the '2' field. 
03. Press [WINDOW]. 
This will open the PLAY MODE Window.  
04. In the 'Zone Play' field, select VELOCITY.  
Note: VELOCITY is the default setting for pads.  
05. Press [F4] (CLOSE) to exit the 'PLAY MODE' window.  
06. Select the 'Range' field in the same row with the '1' field, and set the velocity range to trigger the sample 
assigned to the field. 
The 'Range' field has two fields to set the upper and the lower lim its. You can set the lower limit in the left field and the upper limit in the right field. 
Here, set the upper limit (t he right field) to 63. 
07. Select the 'Range' field in the same row with the '2' field, and set the velocity range to trigger the sample assigned to the field. 
In this example, set the lower limit (the left field) to 64. 
08. Check the result by hitting the pad. 
If you hit the pad hard, the MPC5000 will play the sample assigned to the 2' field. If you hit the pad softly, the MPC5000 will  play the sample 
assigned to the '1' field. 
Tip: How hard a pad is hit is measured in 128 steps (0 to 127). The maximum level is 127. This is the same as MIDI 
velocity, which indicates the pressure used to play the keyboard. 
Tip: You can also use the Q-LINK slider to switch layers. For more information, see 'Program and FX Q-LINK Controllers' 
on page 179. 
 Cycle Switching  
Cycle Switching will play a new sample z o n e  e a c h  t i m e  t h e  p a d  i s  p l a y e d  i n  n u m e r i c a l  o r d e r .  I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  t h e  
samples will cycle through as follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4… etc.  
To enable Cycle Switching, do the following:  01. From PROGRAM Mode, select any sample on the pad you wish to assign Cycle Switching.  
02. Press [WINDOW] 
03. Set the 'Zone Play' field to CYCLE. 
 Random Sample Switching  
Random sample switching will allow all the samples assigned to  the pads to be selected randomly. This way, every time 
you hit a pad, one of the four assigned samples will be randomly chosen to play.  To enable Random Zone Play, do the following:  04. From PROGRAM Mode, select any sample on the pad you wish to assign Random Sample Switching.  
05. Press [WINDOW] 
06. Set the 'Zone Play' field to RANDOM.

02. Press the [WINDOW] button.  
The PLAY MODE window will be displayed. Each sample slot is represented by 
the corresponding number.  
03. Adjust the 'Pan' Field to change the stereo position of the 
sample within the selected sample slot.  
 
 
Tip: Try assigning four samples to a pad, turn on Random Zone Play, and play the pad using Note Repeat. Also, try 
assigning different sections of a cho pped loop to a Random Zone Pad.  
 Changing Pitch with Velocity  
You can control the sample pitch by ve locity (how hard you hit the pad). 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mo de, hit the pad you wish to edit. 
The pad number display in the left of screen will change according to the pad you

 Playing several samples with one pad  
You can assign up to 4 samples to one pad. When you assi gn more than one sample to a pad, you can play several 
samples by hitting one pad. 
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mode, select the desired pad. 
The pad number display in the left of the screen will change according to the pad you hit. 
The 'Pgm' field in the upper left corner displays the name of  the currently selected program. You can change the currently sele cted program in the 
'Pgm' field. 
02. Select the '1' field and select the sample to assign to the pad. 
You can select the samples currently saved in th e MPC5000’s memory by turning the [DATA] wheel. 
03. Select the '2' field and select the sample to assign it to the pad. 
When you hit the pad, all the samples assigned to the selected pad will play simultaneously. 
04. Repeat step 03 for fields '3' and '4'. 
Up to four samples can be played per pad.  
 Assigning One Sample across All Pads (Auto-Chromatic)  
Samples can be automatically assigned chromatically to the drum pads. The 64 drum pads, (PAD A01 - D16) will 
correspond to a note range of 35 - 98 on a MIDI keyboard. This allows you to easily play a melody with a single sample. 
To assign a sample chromatically, do the following. 
01. Press [MODE]+[PAD6] (program). 
02. Press a pad. 
03. Assign the sample you wish to chromatically assign to the 
selected pad. 
04. Select the 'Tune' column and press the [WINDOW] button. 



 123 
The 'Pitch Function' window will be displayed. 
05. Press [F5] (AUTO) to open the Auto Chromatic Assign window.  
In the Source and Original key fields, t he display characters show the MIDI note  number and drum pad number: 36/A01 is MIDI not e 36/pad bank 
A, drum pad number 1. 
06. Select the sound and MIDI note number to  be assigned in the Source field.  
You can select the sound with the drum pads or t he DATA wheel (the name of the sound also appears).  
Note: The parameters of the sound selected here will be copied to each note. 
07. In the 'Original key' field, select the note on the MIDI keyboard/drum pad which will play the original pitch of the 
sound.  
You can also use the 'Tune' setting to apply an offset to the original pitch.  This setting will affect each note. 
08. In the 'New PGM name' field, you can enter a new name for the Chromatic program to be created. 
09. Press [DO IT] to create a new auto chromatically assigned program. 
 Simultaneous Playing of Multiple Pads  
Simultaneous play will allow the triggering of up to four ot her pads by hitting just one pa d. To turn on simultaneous 
play, do the following:  
01. Press [MODE] + [PAD 6] to enter PROGRAM Mode. 
02. Press [F4] (SIMULT).  
This will open the 'Simultaneous Play' tab.  
03. In the Pad field, select the pad you wish to use to trigger other 
pads. 
You can select different pads by selecting the pad with the [DATA] wheel, or you 
can select a pad by hitting it while the cursor is in this field.  
04. Select the field 'Simult1' 
Select the first pad you would like to be triggered simultaneously with the pad selected in step 03. 
05. You can select the pad to be played by turning the [DATA] wheel, or by hitting a pad while the cursor is in this 
field.  
Repeat the process for 'Simult:' numbers two through four. 
Now, hitting the pad selected in step 3 will play the pads listed in 'Simult' 1-4 as well as its own sound. Note that if one of the other pads are 
struck, the other pads do not play. Only t he pad selected in step 3 will trigger the other  pads. This can be used to play extre mely difficult 
percussive parts with ease.  
 Setting Envelopes  
You can set the envelope for the samples assigned to th e pads. The MPC5000 has two envelopes per pad for sample 
programs, one is the Amplitude Envelope, which controls volume and the other is the Filter envelope for controlling 
sound character. 
Amplitude Envelope  
01. In the Sample page of PROGRAM mode, select the pad you wish to make a setting by hitting it. 
02. Press the F5 softbutton (AmpEnv). 
The Amp Envelope window will be displayed.  This window is also available by selecting the LVL field and pressing the [WINDOW] Button.  
'Pad' field: 
The selected pad will be displayed. 
'Delay' field: 
This field sets the amount of  silence that will be played 
before triggering a sample; the la rger the value, the longer 
the delay.  
'Attack' field: 
You can set the sample’s attack time in this field. The larger 
the value, the longer it will take for the sound to start. (Fade 
in) 
'Decay' field: 
This field sets how long a sound will fade out before the sound enters the Sustain part of the envelope. 
'Sus Lvl' (Sustain Level) field 


Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 124 
This parameter is the level t hat the sample reaches when the decay portion is  finished. This parameter has no effect on 
samples set to ONE SHOT. 
'Sus Dec' (Sustain Decay) field 
This parameter determines the time it takes for the 'Sustain De cay' stage to drop to zero. If this parameter is set to 100, 
the envelope will sustain for as long as the key is held down. This parameter has no effect on samples set to ONE SHOT. 
'Release' field 
This sets the amount of time the envelope will take to get fr om its current level to zero after the note has been released. 
The higher the number, the longer it will take to fade out.  
'V > Attack' field:  
You can control the sample’s attack time by velocity. The larger you set the value, the slower the sound will start by 
velocity. If you set this field to  0, the attack time is consta nt , regardless of the velocity. 
'V > Start' field:  
You can control the sample’s start point by velocity. The lar ger you set the value, the bigger delay the sample start point 
will be by velocity. If you set this field to 0, the samp le start point is constant, regardless of the velocity. 
'V > Level' field:  
You can control the sample’s volume by ve locity. The larger you set the value, the bigger the difference of the level will be. 
If you set this field to 0, the sample will be played back at the maximum level regardless of the velocity. 
Filter Envelope 
01. In the FILTER page of PROGRAM mode, select the pad you wish to filter by hitting it. 
02. Press the F5 (FltEnv) button. 
The Filter Envelope window will be displayed.  This window is al so available by selecting any associated filter field and press ing the [WINDOW] 
button.  
'Pad' field:  
The selected pad will be displayed. 
'Amount' field:  
You can set the depth of the filter envelope. If you set this 
field to a ' + ' value, the cut off frequency will start higher than the original cut off frequency and will follow the envelope level. If you set this field to a ' - ' value, the cut off frequency will start lower than the original cut off frequency and go 
back to the original frequency with in the time set in the 'Time' 
field. 
'Delay' field: 
This field sets the amount of time that  will elapse before the envelope will affect the filter; the larger the value, the longe r 
the delay. 
'Attack' field: 
You can set the filter’s at tack time in this field. The larger the value, the longer it will take for the filter to change. (Fa de in) 
'Decay' field: 
This field sets how long a filter will fade out before  the filter enters the Sustain part of the envelope. 
'Sus Lvl' (Sustain Level) field 
This parameter is the level t hat the sample reaches when the decay portion is  finished. This parameter has no effect on 
samples set to ONE SHOT. 
'Sus Dec' (Sustain Decay) field 
This parameter determines the time it takes for the 'Sustain De cay' stage to drop to zero. If this parameter is set to 100, 
the envelope will sustain for as long as the key is held down. This parameter has no effect on samples set to ONE SHOT. 
'Release' field 
This sets the amount of time the envelope will take to get fr om its current level to zero after the note has been released. 
The higher the number, the longer it will take to fade out.  
'V>Time' field: 
You can control the filter envelope time by velocity. If you set this field to a ' + ' value, the time will be closer to the ti me set 
in the 'Time' field with higher velocity. If  you set this field to a ' - ' value, it  works exactly opposite. If you set this fi eld to 0, 
the time is constant by velocity. 
'V>Amount' field: 
You can control the depth by velocity. If you set this field to a ' + ' value, the beginning cut off frequency will start closer to 
the frequency set in the 'Amount' field with higher velocity. If y ou set this field to a ' - ' value, it works exactly opposite . If 
you set this field to 0, the depth is constant by velocity. 
'V>Freq' field: 
You can control the cut-off frequency with velocity. The higher the velocity, the hi gher the cut-off frequency. If you set this  
field to 0, the cut-off frequenc y is constant by velocity. 


 125 
 Using Filters with Sample Programs  
Each pad of a sample program has a 'Filter'. You can edit th e sound of the sample by editing this parameter. This is 
done in the FltLFO page of PROGRAM mode. 
 Setting the Filter  
01. In PROGRAM mode, press th e [F2] (FltLFO) button. 
The 'FltLFO' page will be displayed. You can select the program to edit in the 'Pgm' 
field. 
02. Select the pad you wish to edit  for the sound by hitting it. 
The 'Pad' field displays the pad number of the selected pad. To the right of the pad 
number, the name of the sample assigned to the pad is displayed. 
03. Select the 'Type' field, and sele ct which filter type to use. 
The MPC5000 has several types of filters to modify the sound. With these filters, y ou can cut or boost the specific frequency o f the sound. The 
following types are available: 
LoPass 
This filter cuts out the high frequencies and passes the low frequencies. 
HiPass 
This filter cuts out the low frequ encies and passes the high frequencies. 
BPass 
Band Pass Filter. This filter passes the selected frequencies and cuts out the other frequencies. 
BStop 
Band Stop Filter. This filter cuts the selected frequencies and passes all other frequencies. 
BBoost 
Band Boost Filter This filter boosts the selected frequencies and passes all other frequencies. 
Model1 
This is an analog style 4-pole filter, model ed after a famous vintage semi-modular synthesizer. This filter will clip (distort)  when fed a 
loud input level. 
Model2 
This is another analog style filter with a mellow resonance, and slight fattening distortion in the lower frequencies. 
Model3 
This filter is a crazy analog modeling filter capable of howli ng, piercing resonance and jaw-ratt ling sub frequencies. Watch yo ur 
speakers! 
Vocal1 
This filter is a formant filter modeled on the human voice which emulates the "ah" and "oo" vowel sounds. 
Vocal2 
A 3-band formant filter which emulat es the "oh" and "ee" vowel sounds. 
Vocal3 
A 5-band formant filter based on an idealized model of the vocal tract. 
OFF  
No filter is used. 
04. Select the 'Slope' field and adjust the Slope.  
The Slope controls how extreme the effect of the filter will be. A one or two pole slope will yield a subtle effect, where an e ight pole 
slope will be much more pronounced.  
05. Select the 'Freq' field an d set the cutoff frequency. 
The cut off frequency is the frequency that triggers the filter. When you select the LOW PASS filter, if you set the cutoff fre quency too low, the 
sound will seem dull. This is be cause most of the higher frequencie s of sound are attenuated by the filter. When you select the  HIGH PASS filter, 
if you set the cutoff frequency too high, most of the lower frequencies are attenuated, which results in a more hollow sound. 
06. Set the 'Res' field to adjust the resonance of the filter. 
If you set the resonance value at a larger value, the frequencies set in the 'Freq' field will be boosted more. It is hard to describe the effect of the 
resonance, because it differs depending on the cut off frequency and f ilter type. Experiment with several settings in the 'Type ' field, 'Freq' field, 
and 'Res' field. 



Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 126 
Note: If you notice distortion while using the FILTER, you can use the 'Att' parameter to adjust the level of the signal 
sent to the filter, and remove the unwanted distortion. 
 Controlling the Filter with Velocity  
You can control the cutoff frequen cy of the filter by velocity. With this fe ature, you can control the sound by changing 
the velocity used to hit the pad. 
01. In the PROGRAM mode, press the [F2] (FILTER) button. 
The FILTER page will be displayed. 
02. Select the desired pad by hitting it. 
The 'Pad' field displays the pad number of the selected pad. 
03. Press the F5 (FltEnv) button. 
The Filter Envelope window will be displayed.  This window is al so available by selecting any associated filter field and press ing the [WINDOW] 
button.  
04. Select the 'V> Freq' field. 
The larger the value you set, the more drastic a change you can make to a sample by how hard you hit the pad. 
Refer to 'Filter Envelope' on page 124 about the other parameters in the Filter Envelope window. 
 
 Multi Pad Edit  
The MPC5000 now has the ability to edit multiple pads at the same 
time, setting all pads to the same setting. When Multi Pad Edit is 
active, any change made to a pad will be made to all pads. To activate Multi Pad Edit, do the following: 
01. In PROGRAM Mode, Select the 'Pad Number' field as 
indicated on the right. 
   
02. Scroll with the [DATA] wheel to the left, or press the [-] 
button.  
The 'Pad Number' field will change to 'MULTI' as indicated on the Right.  
 
   
 03. When 'MULTI' is selected, all changes made to the selected 
pad will be applied to all other pads. You can further 
specify what pads are edited by doing the following:  
 
04. With the 'Pad Number' field set to 'MULTI', press the 
[WINDOW] Button.  
The MULTIPLE PAD SELECT Window will be displayed as shown on the 
right.  
 
  
05. Press the pads that you wish to exclude from editing.  
The pads will be deselected as indicated.  
 
 



 127 
 Program Tune  
An Entire Sample Program can be tuned up to +/-36.00 Semitones. To 
Transpose a Sample program, do the following: 
01. In PROGRAM Mode, select the 'Pgm  Tune' field as indicated on 
the right.  
02. Turn the [DATA] wheel, or use the [+]/[-] or Numeric Keypad 
to adjust the program tuning.  
 
 Mute groups  
Normally, when you hit a pad when another pad is played back, the samples of these two pads will be played back 
overlapped. With the mute group function, you can stop the pl ayback of the sample of a pad when you hit another pad. 
Using this function, you can simulate the open/close hi-hat. You can use this function by setting two pads to the same mute group. The pads set to the same mute group will not be played at the same time. 
01. In PROGRAM mode, press the [F1] (SAMPL E) button to select the Sample page. 
02. Select one of the pads to set the mute group, by hitting the pad.  
03. In the 'Mute Group' field, select a number. 
You can set any number except OFF. 
04. Select the other pad to set the mu te group, by hitting the pad. 
05. In the 'Mute Group' field, set the same number you set for the first pad in the step 3. 
You must set the same number to activate the mute group. 
Hit one pad while playing back another. The first sample will be stopped and only the sample of the pad you hit will by played.  
Tip: You can set the mute group to more than two pads. Up to 32 different mute groups can be assigned.  
Note: If you set the 'Play' field to MONO, each pad sample ca nnot be played with Polyphony, regardless of which mute 
group you assign it to. When you use mute groups, set the 'Play' field to POLY.  
 Limiting the Number of Voices in a Program  
Normally, the pad sounds in the program are played polyphon ically - when you hit the pad several times, you hear a 
new instance of the sound every time. But you may wish to play the sound monophonically - meaning that each new 
pad strike will silence the previous strike. This is useful in programs such as programs being made by the SLICED 
SAMPLE function. In this case, you can set the limit of voice number on the pad in the program. 
01. In the PROGRAM mode, press the [F1] (SAMPLE) button 
02. In the 'Program Play' field, select either POLY or MONO. 
POLY  
The MPC5000 overlaps the sound in the program. (Polyphony) 
MONO  
The MPC5000 does not overlap the sound in the program. (Monophony) 
Note: This is the setting for the whole Program, but you can set each pad in a program to individually play in MONO. 
Refer to 'Setting Voice Overlap' on page 127. 
 Setting Voice Overlap  
Normally, when you hit the same pad several times, the sa me sound will be overlapped. When you use the MPC5000 as 
a drum machine, you can make the performance sound natural with this feature. However, when you are using a phrase 
sample, it may be better not to overla p the same sound. With the voice overlap function, you can set the MPC5000 not 
to overlap the same pad sound. 01. In the PROGRAM mode, press the [F1] (SAMPLE) button. 
The Sample page will be displayed. 
02. Select the desired pad by hitting it. 
03. In the 'Voice Overlap' field, select MONO. 



Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 128 
POLY  
The MPC5000 overlaps the sound. 
MONO  
The MPC5000 does not overlap the sound. If you select MONO, when y ou hit the pad several times, only the last pad that was hit will 
be played. 
Note: If you set the 'Play' field to MONO, each pad sample cannot be played with Polyphony, regardless of the Voice 
overlap setting. When you use the voice over lap function, set the 'Play' field to POLY. 
 Mute Target feature  
Mute Target works similarly to Mute Group. The main difference is that 
Mute Target can be set to work in only one direction.  
For example, you can use Mute Target to have Pad A01 Mute Pad A02. 
The advantage of this is that when Pad A02 is played, Pad A01 will not be muted. 
You can set a maximum of four mute targets per pad. 
 Low Frequency Oscillators (LFO)  
You can set the LFO on the pad sample in the Program. By using the LFO, you can get a more powerful sound. For 
example, if you set the Pitch in the LFO page, the pad sound can have the vibrato effect, and if you set the Level in the LFO, the pad sound can have the tremolo effect. The MPC5000 can set the Filter or Pan in the LFO page as well as the Pitch or Level. 
01. In the PROGRAM mode, press the [F2] (FltLFO) button. 
The FltLFO page will be displayed. In the 'Pgm' fiel d, you can select the Program you wish to edit.  
02. Select the desired pad by hitting it. 
In the 'Pad' field, the selected pad will be displayed.  
'Wave' field: 
This field sets the wave for the LFO from TRANGLE, SINE, SQUARE, 
SAW, SAW DOWN, or RANDOM. 
'Rate' field 
This field sets the cycle (speed) of the LFO.  
When the 'Sync' field is set to ON, th is setting value is based on the Beat 
and Tick. For example, if you wish to set the cycle of the LFO to one beat 
of the sequence, you would set this val ue to '01.00', if you want to set the 
cycle to an 1/8 note, set it to '00.48' and so on. The cycle (speed) will be 
changed with the tempo of the sequence. 
When the 'SYNC' field is set to OFF, the LFO will free run, without syncing to the sequencer. 
'Delay' field 
You can set the delay time (the time before starting the LFO). When 'Sync' is set to ON, this will be displayed in Beat and Tic k. For 
example, if you wish to start the LFO after one beat from star ting from the point of triggering a sample, set it to '01.00'. 
When the 'SYNC' field is set to OFF, the 'Delay' field will not sync to the sequencer. 
'Sync' field 
This field sets whether the LFO will sync to the sequencer. 
'Pitch' field (0-100) 
This field sets the amount the LFO will be se nt to the pitch of the se lected pad, yielding a vibrato-type effect. The lower the  value, the 
less pitch variation you will get, and vice versa t he higher this value, the more pitch variation. 
'Filter' field (0 – 100) 
This field sets the amount the LFO will be s ent to the filter cutoff of  the selected pad. This w ill add a sweeping wow sort of effect. The 
lower this value, the less the wow becomes, and vice versa.  
'Level' field (0 – 100) 
This field sets the amount the LFO will be sent to the level of the selected pad, yielding a tremolo sounding effect. The lower this 
value, the less tremolo effect and the la rger the value, the more tremolo effect. 
'Pan' field (0 – 100) 
This field sets the amount the LFO will be sent to the pan parameter of the selected pad.  
The lower this value, the narrower the panning effect, the la rger this value, the wider the panning effect will be.

 Purge Unused Samples  
When you use the MPC5000 to record or load several samples, you may 
have unused samples (samples not assi gned to any pads in the program) 
in the MPC5000’s memory. In this case, it is time consuming to browse the contents of the program for unused samples and delete them one by one. With the PURGE function, you can delete all the unused samples at the same time. 
01. In PROGRAM mode, press [F1] (SAMPLE). 
The SAMPLE page will be displayed. 
02. Press [F6] (PURGE). 
The Purge Samples window will be displayed.  
03. Press [F5] (DO IT). 
All the samples which are not assigned to any program will be deleted at the same time. 
 Sample assignment  
When assigning samples to pads, the sample list will remember the last sample selected, rather  than starting from the beginning  of 
the list each time.  



Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 130 
 
KEYGROUP Type Program 
The MPC5000 also has a program type called KEYGROUP. A Keygroup 
program is a keymapped, multisampled program, which allows several samples to be played chromatica lly across a standard keyboard. 
Keygroups use velocity switching, cros sfading, and key ranges to yield a 
very realistic sound across the entire keybed. Up to 128 keygroups, each with up to 4 samples can be used, to a total of 512 samples.  
 Creating a Keygroup Program  
To create a Keygroup program, do the following:  
01. In PROGRAM Mode, select the 'PGM' field.  
02. Press the [WINDOW] key.  
The NEW PROGRAM  Window will be displayed.  
03. In the 'Program Type' field, select KEYGROUP 
You can also name the program using the 'New Name' field.  
04. Press [F5] (DO IT) to create a new Keygroup.  
The screen will be displayed as shown on the right. This page is similar to the SAMPLE page, with the following new parameters:   
Total Keygroups  
This field shows the total number of keygroups in the program.  
KgLvl 
This field sets the overall volume of the Keygroup. Like SAMPLE 
programs, Individual sample levels can also be controlled in the LVL field.  
KgTune 
This field sets the overall tuning for the selected Keygroup. 
KgPan 
This field sets the overall panning for the selected Keygroup.  
KRange 
This field is a two-part field that sets the high and low key ranges in which the selected Keygroup will play.  
Tip: While in these fields, you can select the key ra nge by pressing a note on a MIDI Keyboard.  
 Adding Keygroups to a Keygroup Program  
When creating a new Keygroup progra m, a new program is created with 
one Keygroup by default, but you can more keygroups. Up to 128 
keygroups can be added. Each Keygroup  can contain up to four samples.  
To change the number of keygroups in your program, do the following:  
01. In PROGRAM Mode, select the 'Total Keygroups' field.  
02. Using the [DATA] wheel, scroll to select a new number.  
 
  
The PROGRAM KEYGROUPS Window will be displayed. Here, you can add or 
subtract keygroups from your Program.  
 
03. Using the [DATA] wheel. Se lect the desired number of 
keygroups.  
04. press [F5] (DO IT) to apply the setting.  
  



 131 
05. To select different keygroups, select the number field to the left 
of the sample list as indicated on the right and scroll with the [DATA] wheel.  
you can also select MULTI, to allow for editing all keygroups at once.  
 
 
Tip: you can also select keygroups two convenient ways. Se lect a Keygroup directly by  pressing and holding the 
[SHIFT] button and striking a pad. Keygroups will be selected by number. In other words, striking pad 16 will select 
keygroup #16. Striking a pad a second time will select keygroups beyond 64 (IE striking pad #1 2x will select keygroup 
#65).  
To select a keygroup you are currently playing, press and ho ld [LOCATE] while pressing a pad or pressing a MIDI note 
on an external keyboard. Additional presses of the same key will cycle through all of the keygroups that the particular 
note belongs to.  
 Sample Layer Crossfade  
Samples can be crossfaded to add real ism to a velocity switch. This can 
yield smoother transitions between samples in a particular Keygroup.  
Turn on Crossfading for a Keygroup, do the following:  01. Select one of the Sample Slots. 
02. Press the [WINDOW] button 
the PLAY MODE window will be displayed.  
03. Select the 'Crossfade' field and set this field to 'ON' 
Tip: Crossfading between two samples will use two voices, so if this feature is not required, turning off Crossfading will 
yield better performance.  
 Panning Individual Samples  
While in the PLAY MODE Window, samples can individually panned. To 
pan samples, select and edit the 'PAN' field for each of the 4 sample layers.  
  
 Tuning and Root Note  
Samples in Keygroups can individually be tuned like in a sample program, 
and additionally, the root note can be set, or the keygroup can automatically be set to look to the sample for its root note if the original note data was stored in the sample you are mapping.  
To change a sample's root note  setting, do the following:  
01. Select the TUNE Field on the PROGRAM Page.  
02. Press the [WINDOW] key.  
The PITCH FUNCTION Window will be displayed.  
03. In the 'Root' Column, set the root note of the sample.  
Any note can be set here, or select 'AS SAMPLE' to use the sample s default pitch. You can also set the root note by hitting a k ey on a MIDI 
keyboard.  



Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 132 
 
 Keytracking  
Samples can be individually set to ignore their keygrouping, and play in the pitch of their Root across the entire 
keygroup range. This is helpful for percussive sounds, or for particular effects.  
To turn off keytracking for individual samples, do the following:  01. Select the TUNE Field on the PROGRAM Page.  
02. Press the [WINDOW] key.  
The PITCH FUNCTION Window will be displayed.  
03. In the KeyTrk Column, remo ve the check mark for each sample yo u wish to turn Keytracking off.  
 Keygroup Tune and Transpose  
Entire Keygroup type programs can be transposed and Tuned as a 
whole. Tuning and Transpose can have different affect on the sound, depending on the source material. When pressing a key and adjusting the tuning, the sample assigned to th at key will be pi tched down. When 
pressing a key and adjusting the tran spose, the note be ing played will 
change. To change the keygroup or tune, do the following:  
01. in PROGRAM Mode, press the [F3] (PGM) button 
02. Select the 'Transpose' 
03. E a c h  K e y g r o u p  P r o g r a m  c a n  b e  t r a n s p o s e d  b y  u p  t o  + / -  3 6  
Semitones (3 octaves). 
04. Select 'Tune' and adjust the tuni ng of the keygroup as desired. 
Each Keygroup can be tuned by up  to +/- 36 Semitones (3 octaves). 
 
Ca 
 Pitchbend / Modwheel / Aftertouch  
The Pitchbend Range, Modwheel Depth and Aftertouch amount can be set in the PGM page. To access the PGM page, press [F3] (PGM) in Program 
Mode.  
Pitchbend 
Pitchbend responds to MIDI Pitchbend,  and can be set to have a range of 
0-12 semitones 
Modwheel>LFO 
The Modwheel controls the LFO De pth, and can be set from 0-100% 
effect. The LFO on the MPC5000 can control 4 different destinat ions: pitch, filter cutoff, level and panning. You first 
have to make initial settings to one or more of these destinations in the Keygroup Program 'FltLFO' page to be able to 
make use of your modwheel. When the 'LFO Depth' setting in  the FltLFO page to one of those 4 destinations is 0, 
'Modwheel>LFO' won’t have any effect for that destination, no matter the setting in the PGM page. With a 'LFO Depth' 
setting other than 0, the level setting for 'Modwheel>LFO' in the PGM page determines how much modulation depth is static and how much will be controll ed by the Modwheel. Some examples: 
'LFO Depth' = 0: the 'Modwheel>LFO' setting makes no difference. 
'LFO Depth' = 68 and 'Modwheel>LFO' setting = 0: Th ere is a static LFO modulation with value 68. 
'LFO Depth' = 68 and 'Modwheel>LFO' setting = 100: Modw heel down: no static modulation, Modwheel up: LFO 
modulation depth is 68. 'LFO Depth' = 68 and 'Modwheel>LFO' se tting = 50: Modwheel down: static modulation LFO depth is 34. Modwheel up: 
LFO modulation depth is 68. 
Aftertouch>Filter 
Aftertouch can be set to control filter cu toff, and can be set from 0-100% effect.

Synth Programs 
New to the MPC5000 are virtual analog, or 'Synth' programs. These differ from sample programs in that rather than 
using pre recorded sounds, the sound is created by a method called 'subtractive synthesis'. From smooth, whistling 
leads, to huge, booming basses, to lush, spacious pads, this method of creating sound can be used to create a vast array of sounds. 
 About Subtractive Synthesis  
The concept of a synthesizer is an instrument that is capa ble of producing a very wide range of sounds electronically. 
The huge popularity and continue d development of synths since the late 60s is due, in great part, to this ability to offer 
so many different types of sound textures in one box. 
A synthesizer’s ability to produce such an incredible vari ety of sound comes from its basic design: it electronically 
simulates the fundamental components of sound and gives yo u control over each part. The term synthesizer means to 
"combine parts into a whole". And that’s exactly what a synthesizer does: the essential ingredients of sound are 
presented as separate parts which are th en "re-assembled" as an audible sound. 
 The MPC5000's synth generates sound by em ulating, or "modeling," the behavior of  an analog synthesizer. Oscillators 
generate the raw sounds. The oscillators are then fed into the filters, which in turn are fed into the amplifiers. As the 
signal moves through that basic path, you are able to adjust the mix of the signal at several points, apply various modulations and envelopes, and add effects. In this way, the MPC5000's synth can generate a virtually limitless variety 
of sounds.  
Voltage Controlled Oscillators (VCO) The oscillators are where sound is born. You may have heard th at what you perceive as "sou nd" is simply vibrating air 
molecules hitting your eardrums. That vibration has to star t somewhere, and in the MPC5000's synth section, it comes 
from the oscillators. By varying the frequency of the vibratio n, the oscillators can produce different pitches, which are 
heard as musical notes. By adjusting the waveform type and shape, the oscillators can produce various harmonics, 
which are heard as different timbres. Each of the MPC5000's synth voices contains three oscillators.  Voltage Controlled Filters (VCF) 
The sound produced by the oscillators is ve ry raw, and usually not suitable to be us ed directly in an instrument. In order 
to bring out the sonic textures you have in mind, you will typically want to dampen cert ain harmonics and boost others. 
This is where the filter comes in. The filter alters the frequ ency content of the signal, and can have a drastic effect on 
the sound. A filter typically allows you to adjust its Cutoff Frequency, which represents the range of harmonics that the 
filter operates on, as well as its Resonance, which determin es how much boost is given to harmonics around the cutoff 
frequency. The MPC5000 has eleven different filter types, each with its own character and sonic flavor.  
LFO LFO stands for "low frequency oscillator". Unlike the normal oscillators, howe ver, the LFOs are not designed for 
producing sound. Instead, thei r purpose is to tweak a program parameter according to a looping pattern. For example, 
if you are looking to add some vibrato to your instrument, yo u’ll need the pitch to contin uously waver up and down. An 
LFO is perfect for this application. Simply hooking up an LFO to the oscillator pitch parameter will get you the effect you 
need. Each of the MPC5000’s voices contains two LFOs.  
Envelopes (ENV) If you hit a note on a piano, you’ll hear a burst of sound energy as the hammer strikes the string, followed by lower 
level of loudness as you hold down the note and let the string ring out, which fades quickly as soon as you release the 
note and the damper is applied. Synthesizer designers mode l this behavior using ADSR envelopes. ADSR stands for 
"attack, decay, sustain, release", and represents the different stages that the sound goes through over the life of the note. Since the most important application of the envelope is to control the loudness of the sound, the MPC5000 provides one envelope that is specifically designed for this  purpose. This is the amp envelope. The MPC5000 also has an 
additional envelope to control the filter. This allows the Cutoff Frequency of the filter to be controlled independently of 
the sound's amplitude. 
 Playing a Synth Program  
Synth programs on the MPC5000 differ from Sample programs in that when you play a synth sound, a single sound is played chromatically across the pads. This allows you to create synth melodies and bass lines with ease.  
 Auditioning a Synth Program  
To audition a SYNTH Program, select the program in DISK  Mode and press [F5] (PLAY)  . The note played when 
auditioning programs can be set in OTHER Mode.

'Setting Names' section on page 20. 
05. In the 'Type' field, select Synth  
 
 06. Press [F5] (DO IT). 
The new program will be created, and the Basic screen will be displayed. 
The new program is a default template of a very basic synth sound. You can play 
this sound by hitting the pads.   
 
 
 Editing with Q-LINK Controls  
In addition to the [CURSOR] buttons and the [DATA] wheel, each 
parameter in SYNTH Mode is editab le by moving its corresponding Q-
LINK control, allowing for quick and in tuitive editing of each parameter.  
The image to the right displays a chart of which Q-Link control corresponds to which control on the screen. Every parameter in SYNTH mode is easily editable using Q-Links.  
 
 Basic Editing of a Synth Program  
When a new program is created, the sound is very basic. To adjust the 
sound to your liking, do the following: 
01. From the MAIN screen, select a track that uses a synth 
program. 
You can also create a new synth program as detailed in the previous section. 
02. Press [MODE] and [PAD 6] (PROGRAM) 
This will bring you into PROGRAM mode where you can edit different parameters of 
your program.  



 135 
Note: you can also use the [SYNTH] button as a shortcut to jump to the last Synth program you edited. 
03. Press the [F1] (BASIC) button. 
This will display the Basic page. Here, the most commonly used parameters for a synth program can be edited. Each parameter can  be selected 
by using the [CURSOR] to select each field and turning the [DATA] wheel, or by using the Q-Links, as detailed in the section 'E diting with Q-LINK 
Controls' on page 134. The label in the lower left corner  indicates which component of the synth is to be edited.  
VCO(1-3) 
Different aspects of the Oscillators can be adjusted here.  
'Wave' field  
This selects the waveform for each of  the three oscillators. The following 
shapes are available: 
'Sine' 
A very pure and simple tone with very little overtones; "mellow" sounding 
'SawTri' 
This waveform has a shape varying from a triangle wave to a saw wave, depending on the 
setting of the 'SHAPE' control, which is located on the VCO page. A Triangle wave has a fuller 
sound than a sine wave, but still has very little overtones. A Saw wave a harsh, aggressive 
sounding wave, with lots of overtones. 
'Pulse' 
Ranges from a square wave to varying degrees of pulse widths. Generally a more hollow sound, 
approaching nasalness as the wave gets thinner. 
'WNoise', 'PNoise', 'RNoise' 
Three different flavors of noise are available - White, Pink and Red. Each has it's own sound, 
white being the most content rich and 'coldest'  sounding, and red being most 'warm' sounding. 
'PWM' PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. This wavefo rm is special, in that it is a Pulse wave 
whose shape is hard-wired to LFO 2. This gives this waveform a range of sounds from a classic 
warbling tone, to a buzzing, harsh sound, rich with overtones.  
'SEMI' 
Adjusts the tuning of each oscillator in semitones. Each OSC can be tuned 
+/- four octaves by semitones. 
Vco XMod 
This parameter controls the amount of oscillator cr oss modulation that is applied to VCO2 from VCO1. 
Cross modulation, also called FM synthesis, is w hen the output of VCO1 is used to modulate the 
frequency of VCO2. From vibrato-like pitch variatio ns, to harsh clanging metallic noises, to bell type 
sounds, a broad range of sound is possible with cross modulation. 
Filt 
 Various aspects of the filter are edited here.  
'Filter Select' Field 
This field selects one of the various filter types. For information on which 
filter types are available, see page 137. 
'Cutoff' 
This represents the range of harmonics over which the filter operates. 
'Res' 
This field determines how much boost is given to harmonics around the cutoff frequency. 
'Env1>Cutoff' 
This determines how much of an effect envelope 1 will have on the filter. [Q-LINK AFTER 8]  button toggles whether the 
effect of the envelope will be positive or negative. 
'Program Level' 
This parameter controls the overall volume of the program.  
Env 
Different aspects of the envelopes can be selected and changed here.  
'VcfEnv' field. 
Selects which envelope is being viewed. The parameters 
below will change to reflect t he state of whichever envelope 
is chosen in this field.  


Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 136 
'Attack' 
This parameter determines how long an envelope will take to reach maximum level when a pad is struck. Sounds ranging 
from a slow swelling violin to  drum-like attacks are possible by adjusting this parameter. 
'Decay' 
This parameter determines how long the sound  will take to go from the attack phase to the sustain portion of the envelope.  
'Sust' 
For Envelope 2 (VcaEnv), 'Sust' determines how long a sound will sustain after the decay portion of the envelope finishes. 
For Envelope 1 (VcfEnv), 'Sust' sets the level at which the fi lter remains while the pad is being held after completion of 
decay phase. 
'Rel' 
Sets how long a sound will decay when the pad is released.  
The Basic page is used to quickly edit the most commonly edited parameters in a Synth Program. More in depth editing 
will be detailed in the next sections.  
 VCOs  
This page is where in-depth controls for the oscillators can be edited. To enter the VCO page, do the following: 
01. From the MAIN screen, select a track that uses a synth 
program 
You can also create a new synth program as detailed in the previous section. 
02. Press [MODE] and [PAD 6] (PROGRAM) 
This will bring you into PROGRAM mode where you can edit different parameters 
of your program.  
Note: You can also use the [SYNTH] button as a shortcut to jump to the last Synth program you edited. 
03. Press the [F2] (VCOs) button. 
This will display the VCOs page. Here, the individual oscillators for a synth program can be edited. Each parameter can be sele cted by using the 
[CURSOR] to select each field and turning the [DATA] wheel.  
04. Edit the parameters of th e VCOs page as desired. 
The following parameters are available to be edited. 
'Wave' field 
This selects the waveform for each of  the three oscillators. The following 
shapes are available: 
'Sine' 
A very pure and simple tone with very little overtones. "Mellow" sounding 'SawTri' 
This waveform has a shape varying from a triangle wave to a saw wave, depending on the 
setting of the 'SHAPE' control, which is located on the VCO page. A Triangle wave has a fuller sound than a sine wave, but still has very little overtones. A Saw wave a harsh, aggressive 
sounding wave, with lots of overtones.  
When this wave is selected, an additional k nob becomes available called 'SHAPE'. This knob 
controls the shape of the waveform. A setting of  zero is a true triangle wave. Increasing this 
value changes the shape of this waveform, adding overtones, until it reached 100, which is a true 
saw wave. 'Pulse' 
Ranges from a square wave to varying degrees of pulse widths. Generally a more hollow sound, 
approaching nasal a nasal-like qualit y as the wave gets thinner.  
When this wave is selected, an additional k nob becomes available called 'SHAPE'. This knob 
controls the shape of the waveform. A setting of  zero is a very thin and nasal sounding wave, 
increasing this value changes the shape of this waveform, adding overtones, until it reached 50, 
which is a true square wave. Increasing this furt her decreases overtones, again yielding a very 
nasal sounding wave at 100.  
'WNoise', 'PNoise', 'RNoise' Three different flavors of noise are available - White, Pink and Red. Each has it's own sound, 
white being the most content rich and 'coldest'  sounding, and red being most 'warm' sounding. 


 137 
PWM 
PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. This wavefo rm is special, in that it is a Pulse wave 
whose shape is hard-wired to LFO 2. This gives this waveform a range of sounds from a classic 
warbling tone, to a buzzing, harsh sound, rich with overtones.  
When this wave is selected, an additional knob becomes available called 'DEPTH'. This knob 
controls amount of control LFO2 has ov er the width of the PWM oscillator. 
'Env1> VCO1' 
This knob sets how much effect  envelope 1 will have on the pitch of VCO1. The corresponding Q-Link 
[AFTER] button toggles whether the effect of the envelope will be positive or negative. 
This is most commonly used in conjun ction with the 'Osc XMod' control.  
'SEMI/FINE' 
Selecting this control will toggle the 'TUNE' controls range.  
When set to 'SEMI', the 'TUNE' control adj usts the tuning of each oscillator 
in semitones. Each VCO can be tuned +/- four octaves by semitones. 
When set to 'FINE', the 'TUNE' control adjus ts the tuning of each oscillator in +/- 100% of one semitone. This is useful for 
slightly detuning oscillators to fatten up the sound, or add a chorusing type effect.  
'Lfo> VCO1' 
This knob sets how much effect t he LFO will have on the pitch of VC O1. This is useful for use in 
conjunction with the 'Osc XMod' control.  
'SYNC' 
Selecting this checkbox forces the frequency of VCO 1 to match the frequency of VCO 2 by locking their 
waves phase when the waves begin their rise and fall during their periodic cycles. When two sound 
waves have their phases synchronized, their cycles begin at exactly the same instant and stay locked 
throughout the cycle. 
As the oscillators are tuned to wider intervals, a new set of  harmonics are created resulting from two fundamental waves – 
with significantly different frequencies – being locked in phase: the waveforms start their cycles  at the same time. This can 
result in harsh, distorted, waveforms perfect for aggr essive dance-type synth leads, basses and effects. 
'VcoLvl' 
This field controls the volume of th e selected oscillator in each column.  
 
Tip: When VCO2's level is set to zero, the full amount of the oscillator is sent to VCO1, but the output is muted. This 
allows for the VCO2 to be sile nt, but still available for Sync  and Ring Mod type sounds.  
'RMod' 
This check box turns on the Ring Mod. T he Ring Mod is another classic analog tone modifier. It generates a series of sum-
and-difference overtones from two input signals, in th is case VCO1 in to VCO2, resulting often in a 
metallic, distorted characte r that is frequency dependent.  
 
Vco XMod 
This parameter controls the amount of os cillator cross modulation that is applied to VCO2 from VCO1. Cross modulation, 
also called FM synthesis, is when the output of VCO1 is used to  modulate the frequency of VCO2. From vibrato-like pitch 
variations, to harsh clanging metallic noises, to bell type sounds, a broad range of sound is possible 
with cross modulation. 
 VCF 
This page is where in-depth controls for the filter can be edited. To enter the VCF page, do the following: 
01. From the MAIN screen, select a track that uses a synth 
program 
You can also create a new synth program as detailed in the previous section. 
02. Press [MODE] and [PAD 6] (PROGRAM) 
This will bring you into PROGRAM mode where you can edit different parameters 
of your program.  
 
Note: you can also use the [SYNTH] button as a shortcut to jump to the 
last Synth program you edited. 
03. Press the [F3] (VCF) button. 
This will display the VCF page. Here, the filter can be edited. Each  parameter can be selected by using the [CURSOR] to select each field and 
turning the [DATA] wheel.  


Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 138 
04. Edit the parameters of the VCF page as desired. 
The following parameters are available to be edited. 
'Filter Cutoff' 
Sets the frequency start point for the filter. This field also appears on the Basic page. See page 135 for more 
information. 
 
'Filter Res' 
Sets the amount of emphasis to be applied to the cutoff frequency of the filter. This fi eld also appears on the Basic 
page. See page 135 for more information. 
'Type' 
Selects the type of filter to be used. This field also appears on the Basic page. See page 135 for more information. 
The following types are available; 
LoPass 
This filter cuts out the high frequencies and passes the low frequencies. 
HiPass This filter cuts out the low frequencies and passes the high frequencies. 
BPass 
Band Pass Filter. This filter passes the sele cted frequencies and cuts out the other frequencies. 
BStop 
Band Stop Filter. This filter cuts the selected frequencies and passes all other frequencies. 
BBoost Band Boost Filter This filter boosts the selected frequencies and passes all other frequencies. 
Model1 
This is an analog style 4-pole filter, modeled a fter a famous vintage semi-modular synthesizer. 
This filter will clip (distort) when fed a loud input level. 
Model2 
This is another analog style filter with a mello w resonance, and slight fattening distortion in the 
lower frequencies. 
Model3 
This filter is a crazy analog modeling filter  capable of howling, piercing resonance and jaw-
rattling sub frequencies. Watch your speakers! 
Vocal1 
This filter is a formant filter modeled on the human voice. This 3-band (3 band pass filters) 
version emulates the "ah" and "oo" vowel sounds. 
Vocal2 
A 3-band formant filter which emulates the "oh" and "ee" vowel sounds. 
Vocal3 A 5-band formant filter based on an idealized model of the vocal tract. 
'Pole' 
Selects how many poles the selected filt er will be. A 2 pole filter will have a milder effect, where an 8 pole filter will 
have a more extreme effect. This field also appears on the Basic page. See page 135 for more information. 
 
Note: Some filters, such as the VA filters, and the Vocal filt ers do not have selectable poles. When these filters are 
selected, the 'Pole' parameter is hidden.  
'KeyK>Cutoff' 
This parameter sets whether the filter frequency rises and falls to match the keys you play or stays constant 
regardless of the keys you play. A setting of 0 means the filter frequency will remain constant across the keyboard. 
If the key track parameter is set to +100, the filter tracks the keyboard perfectly, and with enough resonance, can be 
played as if it were an oscillator.  
The corresponding Q-Link [AFTER] button toggles whether the effect of this m odulation will be positive or negative. Negative se ttings 
mean the filter will grow darker as higher notes are played.

04. Edit the parameters of th e LFOs page as desired. 
The Screen is divided in half. The parame ters on the left are for Vibrato. The parameters on the right are for the LFO. 
'Wave' 
This field selects which basic wave form for the LFO and Vibrato.  


 141 
'Retrig' 
This setting determines if the LFO and Vibrato waveforms will run on their own in the background, or be triggered when a key is  
pressed. With Retrig ON, notes with extreme pitch fluctuations will always start from the original pitch. This is useful for vibrato. With 
Retrig OFF, modulations will sound more "Natur al". This is useful  for when the LFO is 
set to a slow rate, and you want the change to happen over a long time as you play.  
'Sync' 
Selects whether the LFO will sync  to MIDI. When set to YES, the 'Rate' paramet er will be hidden, and the sync parameter will di splay 
different beat synced rates from 8 whole notes to 1/32 notes.  When set to NO, the LFO will run independently from the sequencer . 
'Fade-in Time' 
Increasing this parameter from zero will c ause the LFO to increase in amplitude on a 
curve. This allows the LFO ef fect to 'fade in', like the parameter's name would suggest.  
'Rate' 
These parameters control the speed of the LF O and Vibrato. When the 'Sync' parameter 
is set, the 'Rate' controls are hidden. 
 
 
'Level' (Vibrato Only) 
This parameter controls the amount of vibrato that is applied to the program. 
 
  
 MASTER  
The global aspects of a synth program are accessed in the Master page. 
To access the Master page, do the following: 
01. From the MAIN screen, select a track that uses a synth 
program 
You can also create a new synth program as detailed in the previous section. 
02. Press [MODE] and [PAD 6] (PROGRAM) 
This will bring you into PROGRAM mode where you can edit different parameters 
of your program.  
Note: You can also use the [SYNTH] button as a shortcut to jump to the last Synth program you edited. 
03. Press the [F6] (MASTER) button. 
This will display the Master page. Here, global parameters for a synth program can be edited. Each parameter can be selected by  using the 
[CURSOR] to select each field and turning the [DATA] wheel.  
04. Edit the parameters of the Master page as desired. 
The following parameters are available to be edited. 
'Voice Mode' (MONO/POLY) 
'Voice Mode' selects whether the synt h program will play polyphonically or monophonically. Selecting this parameter 
will toggle between MONO and POLY. When set to MONO, t he program will only play one note at a time. This is 
useful for bass or lead style playing. When set to POLY, many notes can be played at once.  
Note: The MPC5000 has 64 notes of polyphony, meaning that it can play up to 64 notes at once. 
'Trans' 
'Transpose' sets the base pitch of the program in se mitones. A program can be transposed up or down to four 
octaves (48 semitones).  
'Legato' 
When 'legato' is turned on, playing a pad and pressing anot her pad will change pitch to the newly pressed pad 
without retriggering the envelopes. This is useful for lead-style programs.  
'Glide' 
This selects the Glide time of the program. Glide will lag the change in pitch from one note to another when a 
second note is played. This parameter selects how long it ta kes to glide from one note to another. This is useful for 
lead-type sounds and sound effects when the program is set to  MONO. When a program is set to POLY, new notes 
will glide from the last note released.  


Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 142 
'Random Range' 
Controls the amount of random detuning for the VCOs. This is good for simulating older, less stable analog style 
synthesizers. Random Range is  useful for fattening up pads, leads, and all sorts of other synth type sounds. 
'Pitchbend' 
This parameter sets the Pitchbend range in semitones for use with an external MIDI controller's Pitchbend wheel. 
Up to 12 semitones (one octave) can be set. 
'ModW>Vco1' 
This parameter selects the degree in which the modwheel will affect the pitch of VCO1. The higher the value, the 
higher the pitch of VCO1 will increase. The corresponding Q-Link [AFTER] button toggles whether the effect of this modulation will be positive or negative. Modwheel  events can be received via MIDI from a keyboard or as control changes from a 
sequencer.  
'ModW>Filter' 
This parameter selects the degree in which the modwheel will control the filter. The higher the value, the more open 
the filter will become. The corresponding Q-Link [AFTER] but ton toggles whether the effect of this modulation will be 
positive or negative. Modwheel events c an be received via MIDI from a key board or as control changes from a 
sequencer. 
'ModW>Amp' 
This parameter selects the degree in which the modwheel w ill control the program volume . The higher the value, the 
more the modwheel will increase the volume of the program.  To get the most out of this parameter, reduce the 
'Program Volume' parameter and turn up 'ModW>Amp'. T he corresponding Q-Link [AFTER]  button toggles whether 
the effect of this modulation will be positive or negative.  Modwheel events can be received via MIDI from a keyboard 
or as control changes from a sequencer.  
'ModW>Vib' 
This parameter selects the degree in which the modwheel will control the Vibrato Level. The higher the value, the 
more the modwheel will increase the program Vibrato. The corresponding Q-Link [AFTE R] button toggles whether 
the effect of this modulation will be positive or negative. Modwheel events  can be received via MIDI from a 
keyboard or as control cha nges from a sequencer.  
 
'Aft>Vco1' 
This parameter selects the degree in which Aftertouch will affect the pitch of VCO1. T he higher the value, the higher 
the pitch of VCO1 will increase. The corresponding Q-Link  [AFTER] button toggles whet her the effect of this 
modulation will be positive or negative.  
Note: Aftertouch can be received via MIDI controllers, or the MPC5000's pads can also send Aftertouch when playing 
Synth programs. 
'Aft>Filter' 
This parameter selects the degree in which Aftertouch will control the filter. The higher the value, the more open the filter will become. The corresponding Q-Link [AFTER] button toggles whether the effect of this modulation will be 
positive or negative.  
'Aft>Amp' 
This parameter selects the degree in wh ich Aftertouch will control overall progr am volume. To get the most out of 
this parameter, reduce the 'Program Volume' parameter, and turn up 'Aft>Amp'. The higher the value, the more the 
modwheel will increase the volume of the program. The corresponding Q-Link [AFTER] button toggles whether the 
effect of this modulation will be positive or negative.  
'Aft>Vib' 
This parameter selects the degree in whic h aftertouch will control the Vibrato Level. The higher the value, the more 
Aftertouch will increase the program Vibrato. The corre sponding Q-Link [AFTER] button toggles whether the effect 
of this modulation will be positive or negative.

Sample, Keygroup and Synth Programs 144 
 Assigning MIDI Notes to Pads in a Sample Program  
The performance data you made by hitting the MPC5000’s pads  is sent to the internal sampler and sequencer section 
directly. You can also send the data as a MIDI signal at the same time. The perform ance data will be sent as MIDI note 
information. To do so, you need to determine which MIDI note to send out when you hit each pad. 
Also, when you load sequence data created on external sequ encer and saved as a smf or .mid file to the MPC5000 and 
play the internal sampler section, you ha ve to determine which pad to play by th e MIDI note data in the sequence. Any 
midi note number (0-127) can be assigned.  
In this section, you will learn how to assign MIDI notes to the pads of a Sample program. 
01. In the PROGRAM mode, press the [F3] (NOTE) button. 
The NOTE page will be displayed. 
02. Select the desired pad by hitting it. 
The note number of the selected pad will be highlighted. 
03. Select the note number with the [DATA] wheel. 
In the upper right corner of the screen , the MIDI GM standard name of the drum, 
which represents the selected note number, is  displayed. To reset the setting to the 
default, press the [F6] (RESET) button. A ll the notes assigned to the pads will be 
reset to the default setting. 
  
 Changing the Default Note Number Assignment  
Normally, when you hit a pad, the MPC5000 will output the MIDI note 
data assigned to the pad in the pr ogram. However, when the selected 
track does not have any program as signed, hitting a pad sends out the 
default MIDI note number instead of the number set in the program. When you create a new program, this setting will be used as the default setting.  
01. Press the [MODE] button and then the [PAD 8] (MIDI/SYNC). 
The MIDI/SYNC page is displayed. 
02. Press the [F3] (NOTE) button. 
The NOTE page will be displayed.

The note number of the selected pad will be highlighted. 
04. Select the note number with the [DATA] wheel. 
In the upper right corner of the screen, the MIDI GM standard nam e of the drum, which represents the selected note number, is d isplayed. 
To reset the setting to the default, pres s the [F6] (RESET) but ton. All the notes assigned to the pads will be reset to the def ault setting. 
 



 
 
 
Chapter 14:  Arpeggiator 
The MPC5000’s Arpeggiator is a powerful new feature that lets you play repeating patterns in perfect time, much like 
N o t e  R e p e a t ,  s i m p l y  b y  h o l d i n g  d o w n  o n e  o r  m o r e  n o t e s .  T h i s  i s  v e r y  u s e f u l  f e a t u r e  b e c a u s e  i t  a l l o w s  y o u  t o  p l a y  extremely complex (or repetitive) passages of music with ease. 
Editing the Arpeggiator 
To use the Arpeggiator, try the following:  
01. From the MAIN page, select a track you wish to use with the 
Arpeggiator.  
Each track in a sequence can have an arpeggiator (or 'Arp' for short) assigned to it. 
Arpeggiators work best with synth type programs, or external MIDI devices, but 
using one on a drum program can yield unusual and exciting rhythms as well.  
02. Press either [MODE]+[PAD 10] or the [ARPEGGIATOR] button. 
This will open the ARPEGGIATOR page as show n on the right. Note that the current 
track, and the current program are displayed in the 'Track' and 'Program' fields, 
respectively. 
03. Press the [ARP ON/OFF] button to turn on the Arpeggiator.  
04. Press and hold down three or four  pads, or hold a few notes on your external MIDI controller.  
The MPC5000 will play the notes you've selected in  a pattern defined by the Arpeggiator settings. 
05. Adjust the 'Arp Pattern' field as  desired to vary the pattern.  
The following settings are available:  
Up 
The notes being held will move upward fr om lowest note to highest note.  
For example, if you hold down the notes C3, E3, and G3, t he arpeggiator would play the following repeating pattern: 
C3, E3, G3 
While holding down the above, if you were to add a D4, the MPC would then play the following.  C3, E3, G3, D4 
Down 
The notes being held will move downward from highest note to lowest note.  For example, if you hold down the notes C3, E3, and G3, t he arpeggiator would play the following repeating pattern: 
G3, E3, C3 While holding down the above, if you were to add a D4, the MPC would then play the following.  D4, G3, E3, C3 
Inclusive 
The notes being held will move upward then downward from lowest note to highest note then from highest to lowest, playing the 
lowest and highest note twice.  For example, if you hold down the notes C3, E3, and G3, t he arpeggiator would play the following repeating pattern: 
C3, E3, G3, G3, E3, C3 While holding down the above, if you were to add a D4, the MPC would then play the following.  C3, E3, G3, D4, D4, G3, E3, C3 
Exclusive 
The notes being held will move upward then downward from lowest  note to highest note then from highest to lowest, without repea ting 
the lowest and highest note.  
For example, if you hold down the notes C3, E3, and G3, t he arpeggiator would play the following repeating pattern: 
C3, E3, G3, E3 
While holding down the above, if you were to add a D4, the MPC would then play the following.  C3, E3, G3, D4, G3, E3 
Random 
The notes being held will play in a completely random pattern.  



Arpeggiator 146 
 
06. Set the desired octave range in the 'Octave' field. 
Up to three octaves up or down can be set. For example, if t he Arpeggiator is set to an 'up' pattern, and you have the 'Octave'  field set to 1, if you 
held down the notes C3, E3 and G3, the arpeggiator would play the following repeating pattern: 
C3, E3, G3, C4, E4, G4 
The original octave is always played first. To illustrate this , building on the example above, if the pattern was set to 'down' , then the following 
pattern would play: 
G3, E3, C3, G4, E4, C4 
07. Adjust the 'Step' field to set at what increments the Arpeggiator will play. 
The following steps are available.  
1/8, 1/8(3), 1/16, 1/16(3), 1/32, 1/32(3), 1/64, 1/64(3) 
Note: Unlike Note Repeat, this is independent of Timing Correct, allowing for Note Repeat and the Arpeggiator to play 
different patterns independently.  
08. Adjust the 'Gate%' field to set how the Arpeggiator will play the notes. 
This parameter determines how long each note will play, represented by a percentage of t he 'Step' time. In other words, if 'Ste p' is set 
to 16th notes, and 'Gate' is set to 50%, each note will be played for half the length of a 16th note.  
09. Adjust the 'Note Order' field as desired. 
The following options are available.  
Standard 
The Arpeggiator will play the notes in order ascendi ng or descending, depending on the 'Arp Pattern'.  
As Played 
The Arpeggiator will play the notes in the order they were played.  
10. Adjust the 'Swing%' field as desired.  
Like Timing Correct, this will delay certain notes of the Arpeggiator pattern to create a shuffled feel. 
Note: Unlike Note Repeat, this is independent of Timing Correct, allowing for Note Repeat and the Arpeggiator to play 
different patterns independently.  
11. Adjust the 'Velocity' parameter as desired.  
This allows the velocity of each note played by the Arpeggiator to have their velocities set to anywhere from 1-127, or set to the velocity they were 
played.  
Latching the Arpeggiator 
'Latching' is a method of letting your arpeggiator play without having to hold down any notes (or trigger sources). The 
Arpeggiator will keep playing until 'latch' is tu rned off, or the [STOP] button is pressed.  
To use latching, do the following:  
01. From the [MAIN] page, select a track you wish to use the 
Arpeggiator with. 
02. Press the [ARPEGGIATOR] button.  
03. Press the [F6] (LATCH) button.  
This will turn on the Latch function of the Arpeggiator.  
04. Press and release a few pads, or  p l a y  s o m e  k e y s  o n  y o u r  
controller keyboard. 
For example, if you press and release the following keys: C3, E3, G3 
These notes will continue to play after they are released.  
05. Press and release an other key or pad. 
Pressing another key, D4 for example, would stop the previous 3 notes and start playing D4 only.  
06. Next, press and release the keys or pads pressed in step 4. 
These will now play again in place of D4 
07. Now, press the three keys or pads pr essed in step 4 and add another.  
For example, if C3, E3, and G3 are playing, and you press these three keys again along with D4, all four would now play.  



 147 
Try experimenting further with the Arpeggiator, along with latc hing. You will find the Arpeggiator a powerful addition to the l ive performance aspect 
of the MPC5000.  
Using the Arpeggiator with  Pre-Recorded Tracks 
The Arpeggiator can also be used with previously recorded sequencer tracks. To do so, do the following: 
01. Select a track in the current sequence  with previously recorded data.  
For best results, use a synth or MIDI program rather than a Drum type program.  
02. Press the [ARP ON/OFF] button. 
03. The recorded data on the selected track will now play in an arpeggio pattern. 
 





 
 
Chapter 15:  Effects  
In this section, you will learn how to select and edit effe cts. The MPC5000 has four stereo effect busses and each buss 
can have two different effects assigned to it. Busses can be combined in pairs to allow a total of four effects per buss. 
Additionally, a master EQ and compressor are available for th e Stereo outputs. Each pad can be routed to one of the 
four effects busses, and each effect buss can be routed independen tly to any of the available outputs.  
Note: All effects settings will be saved with the .ALL file, which is created when you save the data by selecting SAVE 
ALL SEQS & SONGS.

13. Play the pad. 
The effected sound will play  from the [STEREO OUT]. 
Tip: You can apply the effect to several pads . The effect of the FX 1 is applied to all the pads whose FX SEND are set to 
1 in the FX SEND page of the MIXER mode. 
Tip: You can adjust the send level column to adju st the amount of the reverb for each pad.  
Tip: You can edit the effects in detail. For more information about detailed editing of each effect, see the 'Editing 
Effects' section on page 151. 
Like FX 1, you can use the effects of the FX 2-4 by settin g the 'FX' column to the desi red buss and adjusting the Send 
Level in the SEND column.  
 Buss Effects vs. Insert Effects  
Some effects, such as reverbs and delays, are best used as a buss 
effect, controlling the amount of signal individual sounds are sent. 
This allows for different sources to use the same effect with different 
send levels. 
See the signal flow diagram on the right for an example of a buss 
effect  
Some effects work best when 100% of the signal is sent to the effect, without mixing any dry signal. Thes e are called Insert effects, and 
they include compressors, limiters, filters, Autopan effects and parametric EQs.  
See the signal flow diagram on the right for an example of an insert 
effect  
 Setting an Effect as an Insert  
Here, we will show how to set an effect buss as an insert. In this example, we will set an Autopan to FX2. 
01. Press the [MODE] and [PAD 11] (EFFECTS), then Press the [F1] 
(BUS1-2) button. 
02. Select the first effe ct block of FX2. 
03. Press the [WINDOW] button or turn the [DATA] wheel.  
This will display the EFFECT EDIT window.  
04. In the 'FX 2 Block 1' field, scroll with the [DATA] wheel to choose AUTOPAN and press [F5] (SELECT). 
This brings you back to the EFFECT EDIT window.  
05. Press [F4] (CLOSE) to exit the EFFECT EDIT window.  
06. Select the 'DIRECT' field. 
The following selections are available 
ON 
The dry signal of the source is sent to the output along with the effect 
OFF 
The dry signal is not sent to the output. 100%  of the source is sent to the effect.  
For our example, set this field to OFF. 
07. Press [F6] (GO2MIX) 
This is a shortcut to take you into MIXE R mode. You can also get to MIXER mode by Pressing the [MODE] and [PAD 8] (MIXER). 
08. Press the [F1] (PrgMix) button. 
The PAD MIX page will be displayed. 
09. Hit the desired pad. 
This pad will be selected and its display will be highlighted. 
10. Select the FX column and set the FX to 2. 



 151 
This will assign the desired pad to effects buss 2. Note that the Send Column's control for this pad has now disappeared. This is because as the 
signal diagrams on page 150 show, when DIRECT is  set to OFF, the effects buss acts as an insert, and 100% of the dry signal is automatically 
sent to the effect.  
 Adding additional Effects to the Effects Buss  
Each effects buss can have two effects assigned to it. This can allow for 
extremely complex, wild sounding effects. As an example, continuing from our example on page 149, let's add a delay to the Reverb on Buss 
1. 
01. Press the [MODE] and [PAD 11] (EFFECTS), then Press the [F1] 
(BUS1-2) button. 
02. Select the second e ffect block of FX2. 
03. Press the [WINDOW] button or turn the [DATA] wheel.  
This will display the EFFECT EDIT window.  
04. In the 'FX 1 Block 2' field, scroll with the [DATA] wheel to choose delay and press [F5]_(SELECT). 
This brings you back to the EFFECT EDIT window.  
05. Press [F4] (CLOSE) to exit the EFFECT EDIT window.  
06. Hit a pad assigned to buss 1. 
Notice that now there is a delay effect added to the reverb effect.  
Tip: Setting the send level high, or setting this busses 'direct' field to OFF, and adjusting the relationship of each effect 
to one another using each effect's 'Wet/Dry' parameter can al low for even greater flexibility. For more information on 
editing each effect individually, see the section titled 'Editing Effects' on page 151. 
Effect Buss Chaining 
Effect chaining allows for the output of one  bu ss  t o be  rou t e d i nt o th e 
input of another. Buss 1 can be routed  through buss 2, and buss 3 can be 
r o u t e d  t o  b u s s  4 .  T h i s  a l l o w s  a  p r o g r a m  t o  b e  a b l e  t o  u s e  u p  t o  f o u r  effects in series.  
All Inputs sent to FX1 are first routed through FX1, then through FX2. 
Inputs routed to FX2 will be  sent through FX2 only.  
To turn on Effects Chaining, do the following:  
01. Press [MODE] + [PAD11] (EFFECTS) to enter Effects Mode.  
02. Select the FX1>FX2 field. 
03. Change the FX1>FX2 field to "ON" by turning the [DATA] wheel.  
FX1 will be routed to the input of FX2.  
About CPU Usage 
The MPC5000 has a dedicated processor for effects. Each effect  on the MPC5000 uses a certain percentage of this CPU's 
power. Some effects, su ch as flangers, chorus es etc, use very little power. Others, like 
reverbs and delays take substantially more power.  When adding effects, it's a good idea to 
keep watch of the CPU meter.  
Editing Effects 
In this section, you will learn how to ed it effects. When you scroll with the [DAT A] wheel on an effe cts block, or press 
the [WINDOW] button while an effects block is selected, the EFFECTS EDIT page will be displayed. Here, you can edit 
the effects selected in each effect block.  
Tip: If you press the [F5] (BYPASS) button while an effects module is selected, yo u can turn off this effect temporally. 
This is useful to compare the effected sound and the original sound.

 Effect List  
Below is a brief overview of each effect type. 
Flanger / Flanger Sync 
Flanger is an effect that uses a dela y line to emulate the classic warbling effect produced using two analog tape 
machines together. This effect is best used as an insert  by turning 'DIRECT' off. See page 150 for more on this.  
 
WetDry Controls the ratio of unprocessed and processed signal. At 100, the signal heard will be 100% 
effected.  
Rate Controls the speed of the flanger effect.  
Feedbk Controls how much of the ou tput signal is fed back to the input, creating a more pronounced 
effect. Both positive and nega tive feedback is available.  
Width Controls how much of the frequency ra nge of the incoming signal is effected.  
Delay Controls how much the outputted wet signal  will be offset from the original input signal. 
 
Chorus 4-Voice / 2-Voice 
A Chorus effect uses an LFO to modulate the pitch of the in put signal, which is then added back to the dry signal. In 
small doses this will create the illusion of multiple voices playing at once. Turn up the Feedback and Depth for more 
pronounced “shimmering”  and “watery” sounds. 
This effect is best used as an insert by turning 'DIRECT' off. See page 150 for more on this.

 153 
Shape Controls the shape of the LFO, varying between a TRIANGLE (0) and a SQUARE (100) wave.  
 
Phaser 1 / Phaser 2 / Phaser Sync  
The Phaser is a classic effect that is created by ganging multip le all-pass filter stages to create “notches,” or sharp dips 
in the frequency spectrum. The frequencies of these all-pa ss filters are usually modulated by an LFO to create a 
dramatic sweeping sound.  
This effect is best used as an insert by turning 'DIRECT' off. See page 150 for more on this.

HiFreq Controls the highest point of the filter sweep's frequency.  
Rate Controls the speed of the LFO. 
Res Controls the emphasis of th e frequency at th e cutoff point. 
 
Autowah 
This effect is a lowpass filter modulated by an envelope. The envelope is triggered by the incoming audio signal, and the 
amount of effect the envelope has on the cutoff frequency can be controlled by the incoming audio signal's amplitude. This yields a classic funky "wah wah" type sound.  
 
WetDry Controls the ratio of unprocessed and processed signal. At 100, the signal heard will be 100% 
effected. 
Res Controls the emphasis of th e frequency at th e cutoff point.

Hi Cut Removes high frequencies from the affected output.  
OutGate Sets the volume the effect output has to drop  down to before the reve rb effect is cut off.  
 
Decimator 
A Decimator downsamples the incoming signal by simply removing bits. The differe nce between decimation and 
resampling is that the decimator does not use any filtering to attempt to mask or correct digital artifacts. The result is 
an effect ranging from mild, to almost pu re digital distortion depending on the Decim setting and the source material.  
 
WetDry Controls the ratio of unprocessed and processed signal. At 100, the signal heard will be 
100% effected. 
Decim Controls the amount of decimation.  
 
Resampler 
The Resampler is similar to the decimator in that it removes bits from an incoming signal. The difference is that the 
Resampler applies a complex suite of filters and anti-aliasing to attempt to retain the sound quality. This is a method 
used by popular vintage samplers and sampling drum ma chines from the 80's. Using th e Resampler effect can be 
effective at achieving a "dirty" sound on drum loops, without the harshness of distortion.  
 
WetDry Controls the ratio of unprocessed and proc essed signal. At 100, th e signal heard will be 
100% effect. 
Rate Determines the sample rate the resamp ler will reduce the source material to.  
Decim This acts the same as the Decimator shown above.  
 
Routing Effect Buss Outp ut to Individual Outs 
The effected output of each effects buss can be routed indivi dually to the MPC5000's individu al outs. This is useful for 
recording only the effected signal, or to separa te the dry and affected signal for live use.  
To assign a Buss output to Indivi dual Outs, do the following:  
01. From the EFFECTS Mode, se lect the desired Buss. 
02. Select the 'Buss Output Assignment' Field as shown.  
You can adjust each output with the [D ATA] wheel. The following choices are 
available:  
L/R 
The effect output will be sent to the Stereo Out. 
1/2  
The effect output will be sent ster eo to [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT] 1/2. 
3/4  
The effect output will be sent ster eo to [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT] 3/4. 
5/6  
The effect output will be sent ster eo to [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT] 5/6. 
7/8  
The effect output will be sent ster eo to [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT] 7/8. 
1-8 
The effect output will be sent  in MONO to the corresponding [ASSIGNABLE MIX OUT] output. 
 
Using Master Effects 
The master effect is applied to the overall sound from the st ereo out. You can use it separately from the four effects 
busses. The effects you can use as the master effect are a 4 band equalizer and compressor. With these effects you can 
add the final touches to the sound.

 Editing the Master Effects  
In addition to the four effects busses, the MPC5000 also has Master 
Effects, used for polishing up the entire Sequence, affecting all sound 
from the Main Outs.  
In this section, you will learn how to access the master effects. 4 band EQ 
This is the 4 band EQ (equalizer), which consists of two shelving type EQs for high frequency 
and low frequency shaping and a 2 band parametric EQ. With the equalizers, you can boost or 
lower a specific frequency to control the sound from the stereo out. 
To access the MASTER EQ  page, do the following: 
01. Press [F3] (M.EQ). 
02. Select the 'EQ' field and set it to 'ON'. 
03. Edit the MASTER EQ Parameters as desired.  
The controls for each band are organized into columns. Each of these controls can be edited by turning the [DATA] wheel, or by moving the 
corresponding Q-LINK controls.  
Compressor 
This effect compresses the signal level that exc eeds the selected level to make the volume even 
as a whole. The fields are the same as those of  the COMPRESSOR, which is selected in the buss 
effects.  To access the MASTER CO MPRESSOR, do the following 
01. Press [F4] (M.COMP). 
02. Select the 'Compressor' field and set it to 'ON' 
03. Edit the MASTER COMPRESSOR parameters as desired.

Chapter 18:  Using the MPC5000 with External Devices  
In this section, you will learn how to sync the MPC5000 to the other MIDI devices using MIDI clock and MIDI Time Code. 
You will also learn how to hook up a MIDI keyboard to your MPC.  
MIDI Clock 
M I D I  c l o c k  i s  a  f u n c t i o n  o f  t h e  M I D I  s t a n d a r d  a n d  a l l o w s  s e v e r a l  M I D I  d e v i c e s  t o  s y n c h r o n i z e .  I f  y o u r  M I D I  d e v i c e  supports MIDI clock, you can use the device and the MPC5000 in sync. If you are not sure if your MIDI device supports MIDI clock or not, refer to the device’s operation manual. 
 MIDI Sync with the MPC5000 as the master  
When you play the MPC5000’s sequence, the connected MIDI device will follow. MIDI clock data will be sent from the MPC5000 to the connected MIDI device. In this case, the MPC 5000 is called the 'master' and the connected MIDI device 
the 'slave'. 
01. Connect the MIDI OUT of the MPC5000 to MIDI IN of  the external MIDI device using a MIDI cable. 
The MPC5000 has four MIDI Ou ts: MIDI OUT A, MIDI OUT B, MI DI OUT C, and MIDI  OUT D. You can connect to  any MIDI output, but for  this 
example connect to the MIDI OUT B. 
02. Select the MIDI/SYNC mode by pressing the [MODE]  button and hitting the [PAD 8] (MIDI/SYNC). 
03. Press the [F2] (SYNC) button. 
The SYNC page will be displayed. 
04. Select the 'Sync out' field and then select the output of the MIDI clock. 
You can send out MIDI clock from an y of MIDI OUT A or B or C or D. When you sele ct 'AB', MIDI clock is sent from both MIDI OUT A and B. In 
this example, since you have connected the external MIDI device to MIDI OUT B in step 1, select MIDI OUT B. 
05. In the 'Mode' field choose MIDI Clock. 
06. Press the [MAIN] button. 
The MAIN page, where you play back the sequence, will be displayed. 
07. Set the external MIDI device to receive the MIDI clock.  
08. With help on setting up your external device, please refer to the device’s operation manual. 
09. Press the [PLAY START] button. 
The MPC5000 starts playback and the external MIDI dev ice should start playback at the same time.  
 MIDI Sync with the MPC5000 as the slave  
The external MIDI sequencer triggers the MPC5000. When the external MIDI sequencer starts playback, the MPC5000 
starts playback as well. The MIDI clock is sent from the external MIDI sequencer to th e MPC5000. In this case, the 
external MIDI sequencer works as the master, and the MPC5000 as the slave. 01. Connect the MIDI IN of the MPC5000 to MIDI OUT of the external MIDI device using the MIDI cable. 
The MPC5000 has two MIDI In ports: MIDI IN 1 and MIDI IN 2. You can connect to either MIDI IN, but here, connect to the MIDI IN  2. 
02. Select the MIDI/SYNC mode by pressing the [MODE]  button and hitting the [PAD 8] (MIDI/SYNC).

Using the MPC5000 with External Devices 186 
(EXT) will be displayed in the 'BPM' field.  
Note: The tempo being set in the sequence will be  displayed when the sequence is stopped. 
Note: The MIDI clock signal has tempo information. The slave de vice will follow the master de vice’s tempo regardless of 
its original tempo. 
Note: The MIDI clock signal does not have time information. If the time settings of the master and the slave are 
different, they will still play  in sync but their time posi tion display may be different. 
MIDI Time Code (MTC) 
In addition to MIDI clock, the MPC5000 can sync to and tr ansmit MIDI Time Code, or MTC. MIDI Time code is a 
standard protocol to allow various devices, such as Hard Disk recorders, video cameras and tape based recorders to 
sync together. MIDI Time Code contains location informatio n in Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames, but unlike MIDI Clock, 
it does not contain tempo information. Th e following frame rates are supported:  
 
24 Frames Typically used in video product ions where the finished product will 
be transferred to film. Also used in HD video production. 
25 Frames Used in PAL format video production. 
30 Drop (29.97)Frames Used in NTSC video production. 
30 Non Drop Frames Originally used with music video production, this is the most 
common format for syncing audio devices.  
 
NOTE:  since MIDI Time Code is used to sync vastly different devices, 'chase' time is often required to ensure that all 
devices will be accurately locked to the same time. For th e MPC5000 it is recommended that a song to be synced to 
MTC contain at least 1 blank measure in the beginning to a llow for accurate sync. Most Hard Disk recorders recommend 
10 seconds of chase time. Some tape based video decks require a minimum of 30 seconds. For recommended chase 
times, please see your master device's owners manual.  
 Time code Display  
Hours:Minutes:Seconds:Frames can be displaye d on the MPC5000. From the Main screen, 
use the [CURSOR] buttons to select the 'Now' field. Scroll with the [DATA] wheel. The 
display will change as shown. 
 MPC5000 as the Slave  
To sync the MPC5000 to MIDI Time Code, do the following:  
01. Connect the MIDI output of your master device  to one of the MIDI inputs on the MPC5000. 
02. Make sure your master device is set to send MIDI Time Code.  
03. press [MODE] + [PAD 8] (MIDI) 
04. In the 'Sync in' field, choose the MIDI input the master device is connected to. 
05. In the 'Mode' field, choose 'MIDI TIME CODE' 
When the MPC receives MIDI Time Code, it will automatically determine frame rate, and sync to the master device. 
 MPC5000 as the Master  
To sync MTC capable devices to the MPC5000, do the following:  01. Connect the MIDI input of your master device to one of the MIDI outputs on the MPC5000. 
02. Make sure your slave device is set to receive MIDI Time Code.  
03. press [MODE] + [PAD 8] (MIDI) 
04. In the 'Sync out' field, choose the MIDI output the slave device is connected to. 
05. In the 'Mode' field, choose 'MIDI TIME CODE'

Using the MPC5000 with External Devices 188 
 MPC5000   
Connecting the MPC5000 to a MIDI  Keyboard with Built-in Sounds 
In this section, you will learn how to connect the MPC5000 to a MIDI keyboard which has internal sounds to use the 
MPC5000’s sequencer feature. 
Normally, The MIDI keyboard with internal sounds is set to  generate sounds when you play the keyboard. However, the 
MPC5000 sends out any incoming MIDI signals to the MIDI keyb oard at the MIDI output. So, if you play the keyboard, 
the performance will be played in duplicate. To use the MPC5000 as a sequencer, you need to change the setting on the 
MIDI keyboard so that the MPC5000, not the MIDI keyboard, plays the keyboard’s internal sound module. 
Normally this could be done by changing the setting called 'local control'. By setting the MIDI keyboard’s local control to 
OFF, you can use the external keyboard and its internal sound module separately. 
In this case, the MIDI signal flows as in the figure in th e right. The performance data from the MIDI keyboard will be 
entered to the MPC5000. It will not be sent to the 
internal sound module.  
The MIDI output of the MPC5000 will be sent back 
to the MIDI keyboard, which will plays the keyboard’s sound module. For more information about the setting of your MIDI keyboard’s local control, see the keyboard’s operation manual. If your MIDI keyboard does not have a local control setting, deactivate the MPC5000’s soft through function. In this case, the MPC5000 will output 
only the data that is recorded on the track, not the 
incoming MIDI signal. 
01. Select the MIDI/SYNC mode by pressing 
the [MODE] button and hitting the [PAD 8] (MIDI). 
02. Press the [F1] (MIDI) button. 
The MIDI page will be displayed. 
03. Select the 'Soft thru' field and select OFF. 
The 'soft thru' field determines how to output the incoming MIDI signal. You can select the following options: 
OFF 
The MPC5000 will not output the incoming MIDI signal. 
AS TRACK 
The MPC5000 refers to the MIDI channel setting of the sequence’s track. The channel info rmation of the incoming MIDI signal will be 
replaced with the MIDI channel selected the track. 
OMNI-A  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it is from MIDI OUT A. 
OMNI-B  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it is from MIDI OUT B. 
OMNI-C  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it is from MIDI OUT C. 
OMNI-D  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it is from MIDI OUT D. 
OMNI-AB 
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it is from both MIDI OUT A and B.  
OMNI-CD  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data  as it is from both MIDI OUT C and D. 
OMNI-ALL  
The MPC5000 will output the incoming MIDI data as it  is from all of MIDI OUT A, B, C, and D. 


 189 
 
Setting the MIDI Input Channel 
Normally, the MPC5000 can receive the incoming MIDI data re gardless of the MIDI channel, so you do not have to 
worry about the MIDI channel of the connected MIDI devices. You can change the setting to receive only the data on a 
specific MIDI channel. 
01. Select the MIDI/SYNC mode by pressing the [MODE]  button and hitting the [PAD 8] (MIDI / SYNC). 
02. Press the [F1] (MIDI) button. 
The MIDI page will be displayed. 
03. Select the 'Active track receive channel' field and select the MIDI channel from which you wish to receive the 
data. 
If you set this field to ALL, the MPC5000 will receive all channel s. If you select any  channel from 1 to 16, the MPC5000 will r eceive only the 
selected channel. 
 
Connecting the MPC5000 as a Multitimbral Sound Module 
In this section, you will learn how to connect the MPC5000 to a MIDI sequencer as a multitimbral sound module, so 
each incoming MIDI channel will play a different sound. Up to 32 different sounds can be played in this manner.  
The MPC can be played with a MIDI sequencer, or a keyboard sending multiple MIDI channels. This allows the MPC's 
internal Sample and Synth programs to be played by an ex ternal source, with each MIDI channel playing a different 
sound. To use the MPC5000 as a multitimbral sound source, you need to set the MPC to receive midi Multitimbrally.  
The MIDI output of the MIDI Sequencer will be sent to one of the MPC5000's MIDI IN's. For information on setting up 
your sequencer, see the sequencer’s operation manual.  01. Select the MIDI/SYNC mode by pressing the [MODE] button and hitting the [PAD 8] (MIDI). 
02. Press the [F1] (MIDI) button. 
The MIDI page will be displayed. 
03. Select the 'Active Track Receive Channel' field and select MULTI. 
This will allow the MPC5000 to play a different sound for every incoming MIDI channel.  
 Setting MIDI Channel  
To set which track plays which sound, do the following:  
01. Go to MAIN mode.  
02. Assign the first program you wish to play to TRACK 1.  
03. Assign the MIDI parameter to the desired MIDI channel and MIDI IN.  
The MPC5000 can up to 32 sounds Multitimbrally.  
Setting MIDI A01-A16 will receive the corresp onding MIDI channel through MIDI IN 1. 
Setting MIDI B01-B16 will receive the corresp onding MIDI channel through MIDI IN 2. 
Tracks set to MIDI C01-D16 will ignore incoming MIDI.  
 
 
Select Active Track or Sequ ence with a Program Change 
The Sequencer's Active Track can be selected by sending a Program 
Change message from an external MIDI source. To turn on this 
option, set the 'MIDI Program Change' Field to 'TRACK' as shown on the right.  
You can also select sequences with Program Change messages by 
setting the 'MIDI Program Change' Field to 'Sequence'.  
And lastly you can logically select Programs with a Program Change 
message by setting the 'MIDI Prog ram Change' Field to 'Program'.

Chapter 20:  Other Settings 
In this section, you will learn about the other feat ures, which were not mentioned in the other chapters. 
 Adjusting the Master Level  
This attenuates the overall internal volume of the MPC5000. If you are 
playing sequences with a lot of different samples, and notice clipping, adjust this parameter to a lower level. When playing simpler sequences, this parameter can be turned up to improve the MPC5000's output level, adding a perceptible punch to the sound. This can also be used to adjust the level of the Digital Outputs. 
01. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 9] (OTHER).  
This will switch you into the OTHER mode.  
02. Select 'Master Level' 
03. Scroll with the [DATA] wheel to set the level. 
This sets the digital signal level, whic h will be sent out to the DA converter. 
The MPC5000 can output up to 64 sounds simultaneously. There is a great difference in the level when you are playing 
single sounds or playing all 64 sounds at once. If you increase  the value in the 'Master level' field, you can increase the 
entire level of the MPC5000 to create a more powerful audio output with less noise. However, if you playback many 
sounds at the same time, the level may be overloaded, which may cause distortion. If you decrease the value in the 'Master level' field, you can prevent distortion when you pl ay more complicated sequences. You may find, however, that 
less complex sequences will benefit from increasing this valu e, as this will allow for more headroom, allowing for a 
punchier sound. Set the appropriate value in the 'Master level' field depend ing on the application. 
 
 Sustain Pedal to Duration  
In this section, you will learn how to handle sustain peda l information when you are using an external MIDI keyboard 
with the MPC5000 as a sequencer. 
Sustain pedal data is a MIDI event used to make the sound continue after a key on the keyboard is released. Usually a 
foot switch controls this data. The keyboard sends out Sustain pedal data as a separate event from a note event, so normally the sequencer recognizes this as separate data . However, when you are overdubbing on a short sequence 
loop, it might be better to convert the sustain pedal's data to the recorded note’s duration (the length of the note). For example, if you record the sustain pedal's data as it is, once  you press the sustain pedal during the loop, sustain will be 
applied to all the data after that. If you convert the sustain pedal's data to note duration , the movement of the sustain 
pedal will not affect the other notes. Thus, the MPC5000 is set to convert the sustain pedal's data to note duration by default, but you can change the setting to  record the data as sustain pedal data. 
04. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 9] (OTHER). 
This switches the MPC5000 to OTHER mode.

Other Settings 194 
 
 Truncate Duration  
This setting allows you to choose how note lengths are handled at the 
end of the sequence.   
TO SEQ LENGTH 
The MPC5000 records a note as played up to sequence length.  In other 
words, if the sequence is two measur es long, the longest note that would 
be recorded will be 2 measures as well.   This is useful when a note is 
intended to cross from the end of the sequence to the beginning and still 
continue playing. 
TO SEQ END 
The MPC5000 cuts the note at the end of the sequence even if you hit 
the pad. You cannot record beyond the loop.  This is useful fo r making sure all notes end exac tly on the beat at the end of the  
sequence, and is useful for tightening up drum loops or long samples set to "NOTE ON" 
AS PLAYED 
The MPC5000 records your performance as it is played.  This is useful for when it's desirable to have a note play for a long ti me as a 
sequence loops.   
 Record Aftertouch  
Aftertouch - also called Channel Pressure - is a specific co ntroller event, which is genera ted when a pad is triggered, 
and then pressure is varied by pressing heavier or lighter. The pads on the MP C5000 are capable of sending aftertouch 
messages to both the MPC5000's internal synth, keygroup pr ograms, and to external devices via MIDI. Whether this 
aftertouch information is recorded or no t can be selected by doing the following. 
07. Press the [MODE] button and then [PAD 9] (OTHER). 
This switches the MPC5000 to OTHER mode. 
08. Select the 'Record Aftertouch' field.  
09. Use the [DATA] wheel to select yes or no to decide if the MPC 
will record Aftertouch.

 Adjustment of Pad Sensitivity and Velocity Curve  
Each time you hit a pad, the MPC5000 determines how hard you hit the pad, and converts this to a MIDI Velocity value. 
This parameter is used to determine the strength/weakness of the internal sound during playback, as well as other 
system parameters that the velocity may be mapped to. 
If you find it difficult to achieve a comf ortable velocity range for your playing st yle, e.g. you can not get a velocity of 
127 even you hit the Pad very hard, or vice versa, you get velocity 127 easily even you hit the Pad softly, you can 
adjust the Pad Sensitivity and the velocity curve as desired.  The Pad sensitivity and the Velocity curve can be adjusted 
for each Pad separately. 
01. Press the [MODE] button and then the [PAD 9] (OTHER). 
The Other page will be displayed. 
02. Select the PAD page by pressing [F3] (PAD). 
03. Select the Pad you wish to adjust the Pad Sensitivity by hitting 
it. 
The selected Pad Number will be displayed in the 'Pad' field. The number of the 
current Pad sensitivity and the current Velocity curve will be displayed in 'Pad 
Sensitivity' field and 'Velocity Curve' field. Velocity and Aftertouch will be displayed in meters on the right side of the screen.  
04. Select the 'Pad Sensitivity' fi eld and adjust the pad sensitivity number as you hit the Pad. 
If the Pad sensitivity number is set to a low value, it’s harder to get a high velocity value even if you hit the Pad hard. If the Pad sensitivity num ber is set to a high value, it may become too 
easy to get high velocities even when hitting the Pad softly. 
05. Select the 'Velocity curve' field and adjust the Velocity curve while hitting 
the Pad.  
The velocity curve maps the str ength of hitting the Pad to MIDI velocity data. If the Velocity 
response is not enough even with a range hard/soft Pad hits, try switching the velocity curve 
from A-B-C-D.
