 Installation and Setup 6Installation and Setup
Installing and setting up a Pro Tools | Carbon, Pro Tools | Carb on Pre, or Pro Tools | Carbon E xpanded system all involve simila r steps:
1Unpack the Pro Tools | Carbon or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre units from the box: see What’s in the Box?
2Rack mount your Pro Tools | Carbon and/or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre unit(s) (optional).
3Connect cables: see Connecting Cables .
4Register your Pro Tools | Carbon and/or  Pro Tools | Carbon Pre unit(s): see Register your Pro Tools | Carbon or Carbon Pre .
5Download and install Avid Carbon Central,  PDF documentation, an d other software: see Download Documentation and Software.
6Launch and configure Avid Carbon Central software: see Avid Carbon Central .
7Launch and configure Pro Tools (included with Pr o Tools | Carbon, or purc hased separately): see Configuring Pro Tools .
What’s in the Box?
Before you get started installing Pro Tools | Carbon or Ca rbon Pre, unpack the box, which contains the following:
• Pro Tools | Carbon or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre audio interface
• Power cable
• Ethernet cable (CAT 6)
•
4 rack mount screws with washers
• 4 adhesive rubber pads
• Registration card with redemption  code, QR code, and serial number
• Warranty Claims Information card
• Avid Health and Safety Guide
Keep the Registration card  on hand to register your Pro Tools | Carbon or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre, and access software, sound li braries 
(Pro Tools | Carbon only), and docu mentation and software downloads.
Set the cables aside until you are ready to  start making cable connecti ons. Remove Pro Tools | Carb on or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre from 
the box and packaging, and place it on a hard, dry surface.
Rack Mounting Pro Tools | Carbon and Pro Tools | Carbon Pre Units
If you install Pro Tools | Carbon and/or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre un its into a 19-inch rack, you can use the included rack mount screws 
and washers. Pro Tools | Carbon and Pro Tools | Carbon Pre units, as  with all Avid audio interfaces, need room at the front and  back of 
the unit to maintain proper air flow for cooling. Do not block th e front or back of the unit, or disconnect the internal fan. I t is also rec-
ommended that you rack Carbon and Carbon Pre devices with spac e between them to avoid overheating. If the unit is rack mounted in 
a case, remove the case lids or  doors before operating the system . Failure to do so can result in the unit overheating, which c an perma-
nently damage se nsitive components.
If you decide to not install Pro Tools | Carbon or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre in a rack, you can affix the included adhesive rubber  pads to 
the bottom of the unit to protect whatever surface you decide to se t it on (for example, if you decide to use it as a desktop u nit).


 Installation and Setup 7Connecting Cables
Once you have installed Pro Tools | Carbon and/or Pro Tools | Carbon in a rack (optional), you are ready to start connecting ca bles. The 
cable connections you make will depend on how you plan to configure your Ca rbon system: as an audio interface with Pro Tools or  an-
other DAW, as part of a Pro Tools | Carbon Expanded sy stem, or when using Pro Tools | Carbon  Pre as a standalone 8-channel micr o-
phone preamp or as an ADAT AD/DA converter.
Connect Power
Connect the included power cable to  Pro Tools | Carbon or Pro Tools | Carbon Pre. Then connect the cable to a grounded AC power  out-
let. It is recommended that you use a gr ounded power switch or  power conditioner.
Connect Ethernet
Make the following connect ions with the included CAT6 Ethernet cable(s).
Pro Tools | Carbon
• Connect Pro Tools | Carbon Ethernet Port 1 directly to your computer using the included  Ethernet cable.
Pro Tools | Carbon Pre
• If you are using a single Pro Tools | Carbon Pre instead of a Pro Tools | Carbon, connect Ethernet Port 1 directly to your comp uter us-
ing the included Ethernet cable.
Pro Tools | Carbon Expanded Systems
• Connect Pro Tools | Carbon Ethernet Port 1 directly to your computer using the included Ethernet cable.
• Connect Pro Tools | Carbon Pre Ethernet Port 1 to Ethernet Port 2 on the main Carbon unit.
• If you have a second Pro Tools | Carbon Pre, connect its Ethe rnet Port 1 to Ethernet Port 2 of the first Carbon Pre.
Thunderbolt Adapters
If your computer only has Thunderbolt ports, use an AVB-c apable Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter, such as the Sonnet Thunderbolt 
AVB Adapter  or adapters from Apple.
Thunderbolt 2 Use an AVB-capable Thunderbolt 2-to-Gigabit Ethernet adapter, such as the Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet 
Adapter.
Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) Use an AVB-capable Thunderbolt 3-to-G igabit Ethernet adapter, such as the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to 
Thunderbolt 2 Adapter connected to the Apple Thunderbolt  to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter.Use high-quality, properly shielded cables for all external  connections in order to meet EM C requirements and in order to obtai n the 
highest performance of Pro Tools | Carbon and Pro Tools | Carbon Pre units.
To orient yourself with Pro Tool s | Carbon front panel connections, see Pro Tools | Carbon Front Panel . 
For information about bac k panel connections, see Pro Tools | Carbon Back Panel Connections.
To orient yourself with Pro Tools | Carbon Pre front pane l connections, see Pro Tools | Carbon Pre Front Panel . 
For information about bac k panel connections, see Pro Tools | Carbon Pre Back Panel Connections.
For longer cable runs you can use CAT6  Ethernet cables up to 100 feet.
A direct Network Interface connect ion between Carbon and your com puter is required. Network equi pment such as routers, hubs, an d 
switches are not supported.
In AVB mode, Pro Tools treats Carbon Pre as a generic AVB I/O and c annot determine converter la tency or channel labeling.
Not all Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapters are AVB-capable. For the la test compatibi lity information and syst em requirements, vis it 
www.avid.com/carbon-support .


 Installation and Setup 8Connect Audio
Make sure that your sound system  is powered off. Make the appropriate analog an d digital audio cable connections for your syste m. In 
addition to the digital and analog inputs and outputs on the back panel, there are tw o quarter-inch jacks fo r instrument input on the front 
panel. The front panel of Pro T ools | Carbon also provides four 1/4-inch headphone jacks.

 Avid Carbon Central 14Clocking
With Pro Tools | Carbon Expanded systems, Pro Tools | Carbon Pre devices receive high quality AVB network clock from the pri-
mary Pro Tools | Carbon device, a nd no additional clock settings are required. The Primary Pro Tools | Carbon device in a Pro To ols 
| Carbon Expanded system, or a single Pro Tools | Carbon Pre devi ce if used as a stand-alone AVB  interface can be  clocked to th e 
internal or from an ex ternal clock source (Word Clock or ADAT). To record or monitor si gnals from an external  digital source, u se 
Avid Carbon Central to select the correct clock source. In most other cases, leave the primary Pro Tools | Carbon device set to  its 
Internal  clock. Then, configure external  devices to follow the intern al clock of Pro Tools | Carbon.
To change the clock source:
1Click the Configure  button.
2Click the device menu for th e Primary Carbon device.
3Select the desired clock s ource from the Clocking menu.

 Pro Tools | Carbon Front Panel Operation 19Pro Tools | Carbon Front Panel Operation
The front panel of Pro Tools | Carbon provides indicators and controls for input settin gs and monitori ng functions.
Pro Tools | Carbon Front Panel
The front panel of Pro Tools | Carbon provides various jacks, cont rols, and indicators. To the le ft of the segmented I/O Meters  are con-
trols and indicators for inputs, as well as 2 instrument input ja cks. To the right of the I/O Me ters are controls and indicator s for moni-
toring outputs, as well as 4 headphone jacks.
1INST  inputs 1 and 2 (mono 1/4-inch unbalanced) — Connect instruments, such as  guitars or keyboards. The INPUT  setting automat-
ically switches to INST  when a 1/4-inch cable is connected to the INST  input jack. You can still switch the inputs to MIC or LINE  
(back panel inputs 1 and 2) whil e an instrument is plugged into either of the front panel INST  inputs.
2Talkback Mic — The built-in talkback mic is lo cated within a small hole to the right of the INST  inputs. In Pro Tools, you can route 
the Talkback signal to any output using an Auxiliary Input trac k. To use the talkback mic with third-party audio software, use the AVB 
channel for the talkback mic (for A VB channel mappings, see Core Audio Devices ).
3NET indicator — Indicates the status of the A V B connection to host computer (Avid Car bon Central or Networ k Device Browser). 
It lights white when the device  is connected using A VB and recognized by your computer.
4EXT indicator — Indicates status of the external  clock. It lights green when either ADAT or  Word Clock is the selected clock source  
and the clock is valid. It flashes green when either ADAT or Word Clock is the selected clock source and clock is not valid (in ternal 
clocking is used instead).
5Power button — The power button lights amber when connected to power, but not powered on. It lights white when powered on. It 
is unlit when power is disconnect ed. Press and hold the button for two seconds to power off the unit.
6Input Level Strip and Input Source  — Displays the input source ( MIC, LINE , or INST ) for the selected input channel. The Input Level 
Strip displays the amount of gain (preamp)  applied to the selected in put channel. The Input Level Strip LEDs light green when t he 
selected input channel is set to MIC, yellow when the selected  input channel is set to LINE, and amber when the selected input chan-
nel is set to INST . When an input channel is set to LINE  and the preamp is bypassed, the Input Level Strip fully lights. Increase the 
gain for the selected input channel by turning the encoder dial (7) cloc kwise—the LEDs light from left to right.
7Input Encoder — Turn to adjust input gain for the selected input channel. Press the encoder to cycle through and select input c hannels 
for encoder control focus. The Channel Number indicator for the se lected channel lights green over  the I/O Meters (14). You can  also

11LINK  button — Links odd (left) and even (right ) channel input pairs for ster eo linking. When linked, preamp controls affect both 
channels identically. The even channel in herits the settings of the odd channel settings when linked. When enabled, the LINK  button 
lights green.
12Ø button — Toggles the polarity of the se lected input channel. The button lights amber when the polarity is inverted.
1348V— Press to enable or disable phantom power for the selected MIC input. Phantom power can only be enabled when there is an 
XLR connection for the selected input. When phanto m power is enabled for the selected input, the 48V button lights red. If there is 
an XLR connection for the selected input an d phantom power is disa bled, the button lights white. Th e button is unlit when there  is 
no XLR connection, or if there is an XLR connection but th e input is set to INST  or LINE  and phantom powe r is disabled.
For linked channels, phantom power behaves as follows:
• If both linked channels have XLR connections, phantom power works the same as with one channel.
• If only the first linked channel has an XLR connection, the 48V button lights white but pressi ng the button has no effect.
• If only the second linked channel has an XLR connection, the 48V button does not light.
• If either XLR connection is broken while phantom power is enabled on linked channels, phantom power is disabled for that chann el.
• If the connection to the second linked channel is broken, the 48V button lights red and phantom power is disabled for the second 
channel.
• If the connection to the first linked channel is broken, the 48V button does not light and phantom power rema ins on for the second 
channel.Variable impedances for Mic channel inputs 5–8

 Pro Tools | Carbon Back Panel Connections 25Analog I/O Connections
Monitor L–R Outputs
The Monitor L–R outputs on the back panel ar e independent of Line Out 1–8 (DB25). Use 1/4-inch TRS (balance d) or 1/4-inch TS 
(unbalanced) cables to connect these line  level outputs to loudspeakers for stereo monitoring. These outputs can be configured to 
operate at +4 dBu or –10 dBV, and have  a maximum operating level of +24 dBu. 
Mic/Line Inputs XLR/TRS Combo Jacks 1–8
Both the XLR/TRS combo jacks and DB25 inputs can be used for simu ltaneous connection of mic and line cables to the same input 
channel. This allows mic and line inputs to be switched without cabl e re-patching. 1/4-inch connect ions to the combo jacks alwa ys 
use the Line input, while XLR connections al ways use the Mic input. If a 1/4-inch connection is made to a combo jack, that con-
nection takes precedence over the DB25 connection for that channel input.
The preamp gain on Line inputs 1–8 can be bypassed on a channel-by-channel basis in the Pro Tools Hardware Setup (see Line I/O 
Page ).
Analog I/O 25-pin D-sub Connectors
Pro Tools | Carbon uses 25-pin D-sub connect ors on the back panel for both analog line input (channels 1–8) and analog line outp ut 
(channels 1–8).
The DB25 line inputs 1–8 are normalled to th e TRS combo jacks. If a DB25 line input is  active and a 1/4-inch cable is plugged i nto 
the combo jack for the same input channel, the DB25 input is  disconnected and the combo jack input is used instead.
The DB25 outputs can be configured to operate at +4 dBu or –10 dBV, and have a maximum operating level of +24 dBu (see Line 
I/O Page ). 
Footswitch
A latching or momentary footswitch can be connected to the back of Pro Tools | Carbon and can be us ed to engage or disengage 
Talkback. Both momentary/latching and norm ally open/normally closed footswitches ar e supported. Footswitch polarity is auto-
matically detected when Pro Tools | Carbon is powered on.Optical S/PDIF channels by port at different sample rates

Carbon Pre supports optical S/PDIF input. Each ADAT IN port will automatically detect whether the incoming optical signal is in  
S/PDIF or ADAT format.
Analog I/O Connections
Mic/Line Inputs XLR/TRS Combo Jacks 1–8
Both the XLR/TRS combo jacks and DB25 inputs can be used for simu ltaneous connection of mic and line cables to the same input 
channel. This allows mic and line inputs to be switched without cabl e re-patching. 1/4-inch connect ions to the combo jacks alwa ys 
use the Line input, while XLR connections al ways use the Mic input. If a 1/4-inch connection is made to a combo jack, that con-
nection takes precedence over the DB25 connection for that channel input.
Analog I/O 25-pin D-sub Connectors
Pro Tools | Carbon Pre uses 25-pin D-sub connectors on the back panel for both analog line inpu t (channels 1–8) and analog line 
output (channels 1–8).
The DB25 line inputs 1–8 are normalled to th e TRS combo jacks. If a DB25 line input is  active and a 1/4-inch cable is plugged i nto 
the combo jack for the same input channel, the DB25 input is  disconnected and the combo jack input is used instead.

 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 43DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring
DSP Mode ensures that low-latency monitoring is maintained durin g recording with Pro Tools | Carbon. You can enable or disable 
DSP Mode on a track-by-track basis. DSP Mo de can be enabled for Audio, Auxiliary Inpu t, Instrument, Routing Folder, and Master 
Fader tracks. For tracks with DSP Mode enabled, all plug-ins on the track switch from Native to DSP (if a DSP version is availa ble), 
and all track inputs and outputs, including sends, run on the HDX DSP mixer in Pro Tools | Carbon itself. To ensure the lowest pos-
sible latency for monitoring, DSP and Nati ve plug-ins cannot be active on the same tr ack while DSP Mode is enabled. Any Na-
tive-only plug-ins are automatically bypassed in DSP Mode.
While Pro Tools | Carbon Pre does not have any on-board DSP of its own, it can take advantage of the DSP in the primary 
Pro Tools | Carbon unit when using Carbon Pre in a Pro Tools | Carbon Expanded system. 
The following DSP Mode states are possible, as indicated by the DSP Mode icon:
Native Mode (DSP Mode Disabled) When DSP Mode is disabled on a track it is in  Native Mode and the DSP Mode button is gray. 
All plug-ins on the track are Native only.
DSP Mode Enabled When DSP Mode is enabled on a track, the DSP Mode but ton turns bright green. Al l Native plug-ins with DSP 
versions switch to DSP while Native only  plug-ins are bypassed. The entire signal path  for the track runs on the DSP mixer in 
Pro Tools | Carbon.
DSP Mode Auto Enabled If any track is part of the signal chai n of another track that is set to DSP Mode, it is automatically set to 
DSP Mode. When DSP Mode is auto matically enabled on a track, the DSP Mode button turns dim green.
DSP Mode Safe When DSP Mode Safe is enabled on a track, DSP Mode will not be automatically enabled on that track. You can also use DSP Mode on audio tracks t hat are not record-armed or  input-enabled if you want to offload Native processing 
on the host CPU to HDX DSP processi ng on Pro Tools | Carbon when mixing.

 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 45Enabling DSP Mode Safe
Use DSP Mode Safe  to prevent DSP Mode  from being automatically enabled on a track. This is useful if you want to route any 
audio from a DSP Mode–enabled track with an y plug-ins that are only available in Native  format. For example, you might want to 
send audio from a DSP Mode–enabled audio track to a DSP Mode Sa fe–enabled Auxiliary Input track for processing with a reverb 
plug-in that is only available as a Native plug-in. DSP Safe Mode can also be useful if you just need to avoid using DSP for pl ug-ins 
on a track for any reason.
To enable DSP Mode Safe on a track, do one of the following:
Right-click the Track name in the Track List, or in the Edit or Mi x window, and select DSP Mode Safe .
In the Mix or Edit window, right-click th e DSP Mode button on the track and select DSP Mode Safe .
In the Mix or Edit window, Command-c lick the DSP Mode button on the track.
Indicators for DSP Plug-ins, Inserts, Sends, and Outputs
DSP-Compatible Badge for Plug-ins
For plug-ins that are available in both Native and DSP fo rmats, the DSP-Compatible Badge appe ars to the right of plug-in name 
in the Plug-in Insert selector. Plug-ins without this badge are on ly available in Native format a nd, if inserted on a track, ar e auto-
matically bypassed when DSP M ode is enabled on that track.Enabling DSP Mode Safe on a track in the Mix window
Tracks in DSP Mode provide ultra-low-la tency monitoring, whereas tracks in Nati ve Mode introduce latency when monitoring 
live inputs. Consequently, live audio monitored both through tracks in DSP Mode  and tracks in Native Mode (including DSP 
Mode Safe-enabled tracks) may not be aligned.

 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 48System Usage
The System Usage window in Pro Tools provides a Pro Tools | Ca rbon pane that lets you moni tor the number of available AVB 
Input and Output channels in use, and how much DSP is being used by plug-ins and the mixer.
Input Channels Shows the number of AVB channels dedicated to au dio streams from Pro Tool s | Carbon to Pro Tools.
Output Channels Shows the number of AVB channels dedicated to au dio streams from Pro Tool s to Pro Tools | Carbon.
DSP Meters Show how much of the 8 HDX DSPs on Pro Tools | Carbon are being used  by the mixer an d DSP plug-ins.
DSP Mode Preferences
The Enable DSP Mode when Tracks with Hardware Inputs are Record-Armed Input-Enabled  preference automatically sets au-
dio tracks to DSP Mode when they are reco rd-armed or input-enabled. This ensures low-latency monitoring using DSP Mode for 
all live signal paths. This option is enabled by default.
The Disable DSP Mode when Disabling Record/Input  preference automatically disables DSP Mode when disengaging Record 
Arm and TrackInput Monitor on a track. This option is disabled by default.
To enable (or disable) DSP Mode preferences:
1Choose Setup > Preferences > Operation .
2In the Record  section, select (or deselect) the Enable DSP Mode when Tracks with Hardware Inputs are Record-Armed/
Input-Enabled  option.
3In the Record  section, select (or deselect) the Disable DSP Mode when Disabling Record/Input  option.
4Click OK.System Usage window, Pro Tools | Carbon pane
Pro Tools reserves certain channels for internal communica tion. As a result, the nu mber of Output Channels shown in the System 
Usage window is always tw o fewer than the number of  channels shown in AMS.
A larger or smaller AVB configuration can be selected in  Avid Carbon Central (see AVB Configuration ) or AMS (see AVB Device 
Configuration) to suit your input and ou tput channel requirements.
Any track that is automatically DSP Mode -enabled due to this preference remains DSP Mode-enabled until it is manually set to 
Native Mode or if the Disable DSP Mode when Disabling Re cord/Input option is enabled.



 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 49Workflow Example: Recording in DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring
The following workflow example uses DSP Mode for recording a singer with DSP plug-in processing and low-latency monitoring.
This example session is made up of the follow ing tracks (see the graphic on the next page):
• 3 mono audio tracks for vocals, guitar, and bass. Each track has EQ and dynamics plug-ins, and the vocal track also ha s a
slap-back delay
.
• 2 stereo audio tracks, one for electric piano and another for drum loops. Each track has EQ and dynamics plug-ins.
• 1 stereo Auxiliary Input track for reverb processing.
• 2 Master Fader tracks, one for control room monitoring and the other for the singer’s headphone s. Each has a limiter on it.
• 1 mono Auxiliary Input track for the built-in talkback mic.
The following diagram shows the physical studio connections for this workflow example. While this workflow example only re-
views recording vocals in DSP Mode with a dedicated headphone mi x, you can just as easily ha ve independent headphone mixes 
for the rest of the band.
Physical studio connections



 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 50Adjust the Mix for Recording
Start playback to set the levels and panning of the instruments to get the mix you want  in the control room monitors. Set the s end 
levels from each track to balance the headpho ne mix. Input-enable the vocal track and use the talkback mic to communicate with 
the singer and adjust the headphone mix to the singer’s liking. Once the singer is happy with the headphone mix, you are ready to 
record some vocals.
Session with the band already recorded 



 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 51Record with Low-Latency Monitoring
Enable DSP Mode on the vocal track. Notice that all tracks that are part of the signal chain for the vocal track have DSP Mode en-
abled automatically: the reverb Auxiliary Input track and both Master Fader tracks. All plug-ins on these tracks switch from Na tive 
to DSP format (any Native only plug-ins on any of these trac ks are automatically bypassed).
Record-arm the vocal track, and when the sing er is ready, start recording.  The singer will hear themse lves in the mix with virt ually 
no latency.

 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 52Use DSP Mode Safe to Record with Native Reverb
Let’s assume that you have a Native-only re verb plug-in that you really like. You ca n still record vocals with virtually no lat ency 
in their monitor mix while still using your favorite Native-only reverb plug-in to process all of the audio tracks. Enable DSP Mode 
Safe on the reverb track and set the wet/dr y mix on the reverb plug-in to 100% wet.  Enable DSP Mode on the vocal track—DSP 
Mode is enabled for all tracks in the signa l chain of the vocal track except for the reverb track. Record-arm the vocal track a nd when 
the singer is ready, start recording. There wi ll be latency on the reverb track, but give n the nature of reverb processing it w on’t re-
ally be noticeable. The important thing is that the talent  won’t hear any latency in th e mix with their performance.

For complete information about recording and mixing in Pro Tool s, refer to the Pro Tools Reference Guide, which can be 
accessed from the Help menu in Pro Tools.



 DSP Mode for Low-Latency Monitoring 53Tips for Using DSP Mode
To ensure optimal workflows in DSP Mode:
Use input and output gain controls on Na tive-only plug-in inserts to make up for any undesirable changes in signal level when
switching between Native Mode and DSP Mode.
Since DSP Mode does not reduce latency for tracks that are not part of a live  signal path, avoid enabling DSP Mode on tracks
that are not part of the signal chain for recording and input monitoring. However, not e that DSP Mode can be used to offload
plug-in processing from the CPU when mixing without consequence.
To avoid unnecessarily enabling DSP Mode automatically on track s that are fed by other channe ls of a multi-channel bus, us e
dedicated mo
no bus paths instead of mono sub-paths of stereo busses when routing mono audio signals with tracks in DSP 
Mode. You will need to specifically create mono bus paths in I/O Setup since the default bus paths will always be stereo wi th
mono
 sub-paths.
Avoid routing unrelated sign als to the channels of a multichannel bus. For ex ample, avoid routing a gui tar signal to the left c han-
nel and a bass signal to the right channel of the same stereo bus.

 86Appendix E: Running Carbon in Carbon Pre Mode
Pro Tools | Carbon can boot into Carbon Pre mode for use as a sec ond or third peripheral in a Pr o Tools | Carbon Expanded syste m, as 
a standalone 8-channel mic pream p, or as a standalone ADAT AD/DA converter. Wh en running in Carbon Pre mode, the Carbon unit 
provides all features and internal routing of a Carbon Pre, but the Carbon DSPs, HP outputs, and MON L-R outputs are all inacti ve.
To switch between Carbon and Carbon Pre modes:
Hold down the INPT  button on Carbon while powering on the unit to t oggle Carbon between Car bon and Carbon Pre modes.
The selected mode persists until either INPT  is held again on boot, to toggle back to the other mode, or the Meter button is held on boot, 
to reset the device to its default state.
The front panel of the Carbon illuminates as a Carbon Pre, and certain buttons and LEDs functi on as follows when running in 
Carbon Pre mode:
• The Meter button acts as the clock so urce selection butt on, and the L output meter LEDs indicates clock source.
• The B button acts as the sample rate selection button, an d the R output meter LEDs indicate sample rate.
• The A button LED indicates AD–>DA mode. Otherwise, the A and C buttons are inactive.
• The right rotary encoder, right LE D strip, and Monitor, Headphone, and DIM buttons are all inactive.
The DIM button can always be used when power cycling the unit to reset the device firmware.
