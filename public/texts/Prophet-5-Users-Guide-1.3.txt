x Welcome Back, Old Friend 
SequentialWelcome Back, Old Friend 
It’s not often you get to revisit your past with the accumulated knowledge and 
experience of the intervening years. Even rarer is the opportunity to retrieve some 
of the magic of those days and give it new life.
I was 28 when I created the original Prophet-5. Silicon Valley was just taking 
shape and I had the notion that these new-ish things called microprocessors 
might be useful in designing an electronic instrument — a fully programmable 
polyphonic synthesizer — the first of its kind.
It turned out I was right. The Prophet-5 changed many things: the basic concept 
of the polyphonic synth, how musicians used them, and even the sound of music 
back then. 
Fast forward to 2020. I’ve just turned 70, and after contemplating the how and 
why, decided the time was right to welcome an old friend back to the musical 
stage. So let me present, once again, the Prophet-5. Or as we call it around here, 
the Prophet-5 Rev4 .
Without going into a lot of technical details, I’ll tell you that we designed the new 
Prophet-5 with the original, genuine Curtis VCOs and filters used in the Prophet-5 
Rev3, and the new, Dave Rossum- designed SSI 2140 filter, which is the modern 
counterpart of the original SSM 2040 Dave designed in the Prophet-5 Rev1 and 
Rev2. 
This is why you’ll find a “Rev” switch to choose your preferred filter and a 
“Vintage” knob that will loosen up the oscillators and envelopes just like they 
were in the good old days. It lets you dial in progressively more vintage character 
as you go from a stable 4 (as in Prophet-5 Rev4 ) all the way to 1 (as in Prophet-5 
Rev1 , the rarest and most temperamental of all Prophet-5s).
We’ve even included the original factory sounds. (Listen to programs 511-558.) 
It’s been a labor of love. So grab those knobs and make some analog magic.
Cheers,

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Chapter 1: Getting Started
Chapter 1: Getting Started
The Prophet-5 is a five-voice, polyphonic analog synthesizer with analog 
voltage-controlled oscillators, filters, and amplifiers. It faithfully repro -
duces the vintage sound and features of all three revisions of the original 
Sequential Circuits Prophet-5. It does this through the use of genuine 
Curtis VCOs and filters as well as Dave Rossum’s newly designed SSI 
2140 filter — the modern counterpart of his original SSM 2040, which 
was used in vintage Prophet-5-Rev1 and Rev2 synths. The Prophet Rev3 
featured CEM 3320 Curtis filters. By featuring both types of filters, the 
new Prophet-5 provides the best of all worlds — and all Prophet-5s.
The Prophet-5 is first and foremost a performance instrument. All of its 
sound-shaping controls are immediately accessible on its front panel, 
packing a tremendous amount of power and versatility into a compact, 
easy-to-use format.  
This chapter of your user’s guide provides an overview of essential tasks 
such as how to make basic audio connections and how to edit and save 
sounds. Later chapters explain each of the parameters of the Prophet-5 
as well as how to program sounds and how to use the global  menu to 
manage its overall behavior.
All of the Prophet-5’s essential controls are within easy reach on its 
front panel, so go ahead and dive in and start turning knobs and pressing 
buttons to explore its sound and capabilities. Then, when you’re ready, 
dig into this user’s guide to explore the deeper parts of the synth.   
Prophet-5 front panel


2 Rear Panel Connections
SequentialRear Panel Connections
The rear panel of the Prophet-5 has connectors for power, USB, MIDI, 
audio, and pedals.
1. Power On/Off —This rocker switch controls power on and off to the 
Prophet-5.
2. AC Power Connector —Accepts a standard, grounded IEC power 
cord. Operates over a range of 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz.
3. USB —For bidirectional MIDI communication with a computer. The 
Prophet-5 is a Class Compliant USB device and does not require addi -
tional drivers when used with Mac OS or Windows. See “Using USB”  on 
page 4  for more information.
4. MIDI In, Out, Thru —Standard 5-pin MIDI DIN connectors for 
communicating with MIDI-equipped devices. 
5. Release —Accepts a momentary, normally open or normally closed 
footswitch to control sustain. 
6. Pedal —These two connectors accept a standard expression pedal 
that has a variable resistor on a TRS (tip-ring-sleeve) ¼ inch phone plug. 
Connecting a pedal to the amp connector controls volume. Connecting a 
pedal to the filter  connector controls filter cutoff. 1 23 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Rear Panel Connections
7. Control Voltage Out —Standard ¼ inch connector. This jack outputs a 
0- +5V signal for interfacing with modular synthesizers and other devices 
that support this  type of connectivity. It is configured for 1-volt-per-
octave operation for gear that recognizes that standard. The CV output 
tracks the last note played on the Prophet-5 keyboard.
8. Gate Out —Standard ¼ inch connector. This jack outputs a 15-volt 
on/off signal typically used to gate the envelopes of an external synth 
that supports this  type of connectivity. The Gate Out signal is triggered 
whenever a key is pressed on the Prophet-5.
9. Control Voltage In —Standard ¼ inch connector. This jack accepts 
a 0 to + 5V signal for interfacing with modular synthesizers and other 
devices that support this  type of connectivity. They are configured for 
1-volt-per-octave operation for gear that recognizes that standard. A CV 
In signal affects only a single voice of the Prophet-5.
10. Gate In —Standard ¼ inch connector. This jack accepts a 1.5 to 
15-volt on/off signal to gate the envelopes of a single voice on the 
Prophet-5. Whenever a ¼ inch connector is inserted into the rear-panel 
gate in jack on the Prophet-5, its keyboard polyphony is reduced to 
4 voices. The envelopes of the fifth voice are triggered by the gate in 
signal.
11. Phones — ¼ inch stereo headphone jack. Headphone volume is 
controlled by the volume  knob on the front panel. 
12. Audio Out —Unbalanced, ¼ inch audio output. 1 23 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12

SequentialUsing USB
The Prophet-5’s USB 2.0 port enables bidirectional MIDI communica -
tion with a computer. A MIDI interface and MIDI cables are not neces -
sary, just a USB cable. The Prophet-5 is a Class Compliant USB device. 
That means it does not require any additional drivers to be installed to 
communicate with a Mac or Windows computer. The Prophet-5 transmits 
and receives MIDI data via USB, but does not transmit audio.
MIDI In and USB should not be used at the same time, as overlapping 
messages from different sources may cause the Prophet-5 to respond unpredictably. 
MIDI Out and USB can be used at the same time and transmit the same data.
Under Mac OS, “Prophet-5/10” will appear as a MIDI port when 
connected via USB and can be configured using the Mac’s Audio MIDI 
Setup utility (typically found in Applications/Utilities).
Under Windows, the first time the Prophet-5 is connected via USB, the 
“Found new hardware” alert appears and it is automatically installed as 
“Prophet-5.”
In Windows, if you unplug the USB cable and plug it back in while a 
program has the Prophet-5 port open, you may have to resync. That 
usually means going to the Prophet-5 Keyboard Properties — in the 
Windows Device Manager under “Sound, video, and game controllers” 
— and clicking OK. If Prophet-5 is no longer listed in the Device Manager, 
turn off the Prophet-5 then turn it back on again while it is connected via 
USB. It should be detected on power up.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Setting Up the Prophet-5
Setting Up the Prophet-5
Here’s how to get your Prophet-5 up and running:
1. Plug the power cable into the AC power connector on the back panel of 
the Prophet-5.
2. If you have an expression pedal, connect it to amp (for volume) or 
filter  (for filter cutoff)  on the back of the Prophet-5. If you have a 
sustain pedal, connect it to the release  jack. 
3. Turn on the Prophet-5.
4. Connect the audio  out connector on the back of the Prophet-5 to your 
amp/mixer/powered speakers using an unbalanced, ¼ inch audio cable. 
This is the main (mono) output for the synth. 
5. Turn up the volume on your amp/mixer/powered speakers.
6. Turn up the volume on the Prophet-5. 
7. Use the group , bank , and program  switches to explore factory sounds. 
Calibrating the Oscillators and Filters
The first time you use the Prophet-5, please run its built-in calibration 
procedure. Repeat the calibration procedure as needed over the next few 
days of use. The Prophet-5 learns the range of temperatures at your loca -
tion and will keep itself in tune over this range. 
Later, if you use the Prophet-5 in a different environment that is measur -
ably warmer or cooler (on stage, in an air-conditioned studio, and so on) 
run the calibration procedure again.
To calibrate the oscillators and filters:
1. Press the tune button. The program select  button  LEDs begin flash -
ing in sequence and the numeric display indicates the tuning sequence 
while the Prophet-5 performs its auto-calibration procedure. Don’t turn 
off the power while it’s doing this.
2. When finished, the front panel controls return to normal and you can 
play the Prophet-5.


6 Setting Up the Prophet-5
SequentialSound Banks
The Prophet-5 contains a total of 400 programs. 200 are permanent 
“Factory” programs and 200 are “User” programs that can be over -
written. You can edit the programs of either set, but you can only save 
sounds to the User set. 
When the factory  switch is enabled, the permanent Factory sound set is 
active. When the factory  switch is disabled, the User sound set is active. 
As shipped from the factory, both sound sets are identical. 
Group, Bank, and Program  Number selectors
Selecting Programs
Use the group , bank , and program  selector  buttons to select and recall 
programs.
To choose a program:
1. Press the group  select  button to specify the “hundreds” bank of the 
program. Each time you press the button, the number increments and 
cycles through Groups 1-5.
2. Press the bank  select  button to specify the “tens” bank of the program. 
Each time you press the button, the number increments and cycles 
through Banks 1-5.
3. Press the a program  selector  button (1-8) to specify the “ones” digit of 
the program. 
To choose program 123, for example:
1. Press the group  select  button as many times as needed to cycle around to 
1.
2. Press the bank  select  button as many times as need to cycle around to 2.
3. Press program  selector  button 3.


7
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Setting Up the Prophet-5
It’s not always necessary to enter all 3 digits of a program number to 
recall it.
For example:
• If the current program is 111 and you want to recall program 118, 
simply press “8.”
• If the current program is 111 and you want to recall program 121, 
simply press the bank  select  button as many times as necessary to 
cycle around to “2.”
• If the current program is 111 and you want to recall program 211, 
simply press the group  select  button as many times as necessary to 
cycle around to “2.”
Pressing the globals  button three times in a row saves the current program as 
the default program that appears when you turn on the Prophet-5.
Editing Programs
Because all of the sound-shaping controls of the Prophet-5 appear on its 
front panel, editing an existing program is simple: just turn a knob and listen 
to its effect. Keep turning knobs and pressing buttons and if you like what 
you’ve created, save the program. (See “Saving a Program” on page 9 .)
How to Check a Parameter Setting in a Preset
When you’re editing a preset, the Prophet-5 has a convenient way of indicat -
ing the programmed (saved) value for any knob parameter: Whenever you 
turn a knob and reach the saved value of a given parameter, an LED dot in 
the main Prophet-5 display will illuminate. 
This dot illuminates
The dot illuminates when a knob position matches a preset’s saved parameter value


8 Setting Up the Prophet-5
SequentialComparing an Edited Program to its Original State
When editing a program, it’s often useful to compare its edited state to 
its original state to evaluate your edits. Alternatively, before saving a 
program to a new location you may want to check the program in the 
target location before you overwrite it. 
To compare an edited program to a saved version:
1. Edit a program.
2. Press the record  button. It starts flashing.
3. Press the global  button. Both LEDs on the button light up, indicating 
compare  mode.
4. Play the keyboard to hear the saved version of the sound.
5. To disable the compare function and return to the edited sound, turn off 
the global  button. Programs can’t be written while in compare mode.
6. If you want to save the edited sound, the record  button is still flash -
ing and ready to save, so enter a location with the program  selector  
buttons. The sound is saved.
7. Alternatively, if you want to cancel saving and continue editing, press 
the record  button. It stops flashing and saving is canceled.
Creating a Program from Scratch
An existing program can be very useful as a jumping off point for new 
sounds. But it’s also useful (and educational) to create a new sound from 
scratch. The Prophet-5 makes this easy by providing a “Basic Preset” 
that you can quickly recall at any time. This preset is very simple, with a 
single oscillator as its basis. 
To recall the Basic Preset:
1. Hold down the record  button. 
2. Press the preset  button.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Setting Up the Prophet-5
Live Panel Mode
The Prophet-5 also features a “live panel” mode in which its sound 
switches to the current settings of its knobs and switches. In other words, 
the current preset is ignored and what you see on the front panel is what you 
hear. This is a great mode for learning, experimentation, and instant gratification.
To enter live panel mode:
• Press the preset  button to toggle it off. Changing Groups, Banks or 
Programs with Preset off won’t affect the sound.  
To return to preset mode:
• Press the preset  button again to toggle it on. 
PRESET
Toggling off the preset  button enables “live panel” mode
Saving a Program
If you’ve created a sound that you like, you’ll probably want to save it. 
Saving a program overwrites a previously saved program. Sound design -
ers often save many incremental versions of a program as they continue 
to refine it. These intermediate versions often make good jumping off 
points for new sounds. 
To save an edited program to the same preset location:
1. Press the  record  button. Its LED begins blinking.
2. Press a program  selector  button (1-8) to specify the “ones” digit of the 
program. 
3. The record  button LED stops blinking and the program is saved into 
the User sound set.
Be careful when record  is enabled. You can change groups  and banks  without 
executing write , but once you press a program  selector  button (1-8) for the “ones” 
digit, the record  command is executed and the program at that location is overwritten.


10 Setting Up the Prophet-5
SequentialTo save a program to a different Group and/or Bank location:
1. Press the  record  button. Its LED begins blinking.
2. Press the group  button repeatedly to toggle through banks 1-5 to find 
the desired group  location.
3. Press the bank  button repeatedly to toggle through banks 1-5 to find the 
desired bank  location.
4. Press a program  selector  button (1-8) to specify the “ones” digit of the 
program. The  record  button LED stops blinking and the program is 
saved into the User sound set.
Canceling Save
Sometimes you may want to cancel saving a program before you 
commit.
To cancel the Save process before you commit:
• If the record  button LED is flashing, press it again. The LED stops 
flashing and saving is canceled. You can return to editing if you want.
Comparing Before You Save
Before saving a program to a new location, it’s a good idea to listen to the 
program in the target location to make sure you really want to overwrite it. 
To evaluate a program before you overwrite it: 
1. Get ready to save by pressing the record  button. It starts flashing.
2. Press the global  button. Both LEDs on the button light up, indicating 
compare  mode.
3. Use the program buttons to navigate to the sound you want to compare 
and play the keyboard to hear the sound.
4. To disable the compare function and go back to the edited sound, turn 
off the global  button. Programs can’t be written while in compare 
mode.
5. If you want to save the edited sound, the record  button is still flashing 
and ready to save, so enter a location with the program buttons. The 
sound is saved.
6. Alternatively, if you want to cancel saving and continue editing, press 
the record  button. It stops flashing and saving is canceled.

we’d like to point you toward a few things that will help you tailor it to 
your needs. The better you know it, the more you’ll get out of it.
First, read “Global Settings” on page 12 . There are useful settings 
and functions found in the Globals that will affect the overall behavior 
of your Prophet-5, including tuning, MIDI connections, calibration, and 
more. In particular, read about Pot Modes and determine which works 
best for you when you’re editing sounds. 
Also, if you haven’t already done so, read  “Rear Panel Connections” 
on page 2  to learn about the various connectors on the back of your 
Prophet-5 and how you can use its various pedal, audio, MIDI, and USB 
inputs and outputs.
Finally, be on the lookout for tips and notes scattered throughout this 
manual to gain a better working knowledge of the Prophet-5. We wish 
you many hours of musical exploration!   


12 Chapter 2: Prophet-5 Controls
SequentialChapter 2: Prophet-5 Controls
This chapter explains all of the front-panel controls of the Prophet-5, 
section by section and the role each plays in synthesizing sounds. If 
you’re just getting started with synthesis, take a look at Chapter 4, 
Creating Sounds , for step-by-step tutorials on how to program some 
classic sounds such as synth bass, brass, strings, and more.
Global Settings
Global settings are parameters that affect all programs. These include 
settings such as MIDI Channel, Velocity and Aftertouch Response, and 
others. Global parameters are printed above the numeric program selec -
tor switches (1 - 8). Use the Globals switch to choose between the two 
sets. The red LED indicates that the upper row is active. The yellow 
LED indicates that the lower row is active

Globals - Top Row
1. Transpose:  -12…12—Master Transpose control, 0 is centered. Steps 
in semitones up to one octave up (+12) or down (-12).
2. MIDI Channel:  ALL, 1…16—Selects which MIDI channel to send and 
receive data, 1 to 16. all receives on all 16 channels.
3. Param Xmit:  Off, CC, NRn —Changes to the values of front panel 
controls are transmitted via MIDI as Continuous Controllers (CC) or 
Non-registered Parameter Number (NRn). Transmission of parameters 
can also be turned off. You could, for example, turn the filter cutoff  
frequency knob on the Prophet-5 and have it affect the cutoff frequency 
of another synthesizer. For a list of Prophet-5 CCs and NRPNs, see the 
Support page for the Prophet-5 on the Sequential website.
NRPNs are the preferred method of parameter transmission, since they cover 
the complete range of all parameters, while CCs are limited to a range of 128. For a 
list of Prophet-5 CCs and NRPNs, see the Prophet-5 Support page at Sequential.com.


14 Global Settings
Sequential4. Param Rcv:  Off, CC, NRn—Sets the method by which parameter changes 
are received via MIDI. As with transmission, NRPNs are the preferred method.
5. MIDI Control:  Off, On—When On, the synth will respond to MIDI 
controllers, including Pitch Wheel, Mod Wheel, Pedal, V olume.
6. MIDI Sysex:  Mdi, USB— When set to MIDI ( Mdi) it will receive 
and transmit them using the MIDI ports/cables When set to USB it 
will receive and transmit them using the USB port/cable. MIDI SysEx 
messages are used when sending and receiving a variety of data includ -
ing, programs, alternative tunings, system updates, and more.  
7. MIDI Out:  Off, Mdi , USB, ALL—Sets the port by which MIDI data will 
be transmitted (MIDI and/or USB).
8. Local Control:  Off, SOm, ALL—When on (the default), the keyboard 
and front panel controls directly affect the Prophet-5. When off, the front 
panel controls are transmitted via MIDI but do not directly affect the 
“local” synth (that is, the Prophet-5). This is primarily useful for avoid -
ing MIDI data loops that can occur with some external sequencers. When 
set to “ SOn ” the front panel controls of the Prophet-5 remain active, but 
the pitch and mod wheels do not directly affect the “local” synth (that is, 
the Prophet-5).
Globals - Bottom Row
1. Pot Mode:  REL, Pas, Jup (Relative, Passthru, Jump)— There are three pot 
(potentiometer) modes to determine how the synth reacts when the program -
mable parameters are edited. (Master volume is not programmable, so these 
modes don’t apply.)
In Relative  mode, changes are relative to the stored setting. In Relative mode, the 
full value range is not available until either the minimum or maximum value and 
the respective lower or upper limit of the pot’s travel is reached.  For example, 
the resonance  parameter has an internal value range of 0 to 127. Let’s 
say the physical position of the resonance  pot is the equivalent to an 
internal value of 100. If you switch to a program that has a stored Reso -
nance value of 63 and turn the pot all the way up, it will only go to 90. 
To get to the maximum value of 127, you first have to turn down until the 
value is at the other extreme and the pot is at the limit of its travel (in this 
case, 0 and fully counter-clockwise, respectively).


15
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Global Settings
In Passthru  mode, turning the pot has no effect until after the edited 
value equals the preset value (that is, until the edited value “passes 
through” the stored value). 
Jump  mode uses an absolute value based upon the position of the pot 
when edited: turn a pot and the value jumps immediately from the stored 
value to the edited value.
2. Release/Sustain :  reL, HLd (Release, Hold)— This determines how 
the front panel release  switch affects the release  parameter of both the 
Filter Envelope and Amplifier Envelope. 
The release  switch affects the behavior of the Filter and Amplifier Enve -
lopes. The original Prophet-5 had a different way of handling Release 
from the more common method used today. If the release  switch is on, 
the release  knob setting on the Filter and Amplifier envelopes is used. If 
the release  switch is off, the Release on both envelopes is fast.
If you then connect a footswitch, it acts somewhat like a piano: it’s 
a quick release when the footswitch is not pressed, and it’s a longer 
(programmed by the knob) release when the footswitch is held. Note that 
the release  switch needs to be off for the footswitch to operate this way. 
Since this is, after all, a Prophet-5, we wanted it to match the original 
synth. These days, however, many musicians expect the footswitch to be 
a “hold” function, which is of course different than the Prophet-5 release 
switch. So, we added a Global parameter that allows you to select the 
original Prophet-5 method, or a more common hold function with the 
footswitch.
Use the release /sustain  parameter to choose between classic Prophet-5 
Release handling ( rEL) or the more contemporary Hold method ( HLd). 
3. Pedal Mode:  nOL, REU (Normal, Reversed) — Sets the Prophet-5’s 
response to an expression connected to either the amp jack or filter  jack 
on the rear of the Prophet-5. There are two main wiring schemes for 
expression pedals that use a TRS connector. The most common connects 
the wiper of the pedal’s potentiometer to the tip of the jack, while the 
reference voltage is connected to the ring of the jack. Alternatively, 
pedals may be wired in reverse, with the wiper connected to the ring 


16 Global Settings
Sequentialof the jack and the reference voltage to the tip. Either type can be used 
with the Prophet-5. If the expression pedal causes abrupt changes in the 
parameter (instead of smooth, continuous control) try switching this 
mode.
4. Alt Tuning:  NOL, 1…16 (Normal, 1…16)— Selects one of the Prophet-5’s 
built-in tunings. Set to normal  (NOL) the tuning is standard, chromatic tuning. 
Choosing 1 through 16 selects an alternative, non-chromatic, non-Western 
scale that can be used to emulate ethnic instruments or in other creative ways. 
See “Appendix D: Alternative Tunings” on page 64  for a description of 
each tuning. Additional tunings can be imported into the Prophet-5 as a 
SysEx message. 
5. Vel Response:  0-6 (Curve 0, Curve 1, Curve 2, Curve 3, Curve 4, Curve 
5, Curve 6)— Sets one of seven velocity curves to adjust the keyboard’s velocity 
response to your playing style. 
6. AT Response:  0-7 (Curve 0, Curve 1, ... Curve 7)— Sets one of eight 
pressure curves to adjust the keyboard’s aftertouch response to your play -
ing style.
7. Pgm Dump: PrO, Ban, GrP, USr, ALL (Program, Bank, Group, User 
Banks, All)— Transmits the current program, the current bank, the current 
group, all user banks, or all banks (both user and factory) in SysEx 
format via the selected MIDI port. (See “Appendix C: Exporting and 
Importing Programs/Banks” on page 62 . Dumped programs will load 
back into the same bank and program location in memory when received by 
the Prophet-5 via MIDI.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Oscillators
Oscillators
Oscillators provide the raw building blocks of the Prophet-5’s sound by 
producing waveforms , each of which has its own inherent sound charac -
ter based on its harmonic content. The Prophet-5 has two oscillators per 
voice. Level controls for each of these are located in the Mixer section.
Oscillator A is capable of simultaneously generating sawtooth and 
variable-width pulse waves. Oscillator B is capable of simultaneously 
generating sawtooth, triangle, and variable-width pulse waves. 
 The oscillators on the Prophet-5 are very stable. To emulate the random 
pitch drift and oscillator instability of vintage instruments, use the vintage  knob to add 
randomness to the behavior of the VCOs, envelopes, LFOs, and filters.
The Oscillators section  
Oscillator A can be hard-synced to Oscillator B for complex, harmoni -
cally-rich sounds when modulated. 
Oscillator B features a fine knob for detuning and thickening sounds, 
a lo freq switch that allows it to function as an LFO for modulation 
purposes, and a keyboard  switch that disables keyboard control over its 
pitch (useful when used as an LFO, or for drones and other effects). 


18 Oscillators
SequentialOscillator Controls
Frequency: Sets the base oscillator frequency over a 4-octave range. 
Adjustment is in semitones. 
The Master Tune knob affects the pitch of all oscillators, as does the Transpose 
parameter in the Globals section.
Fine:  This adjusts the tuning of Oscillator B upward (sharp) and has a 
range of nearly a semitone. 
Shape:  Sawtooth, Triangle, Square/Pulse— Selects the waveshape gener -
ated by the oscillator. You can turn on multiple waveshapes simultane -
ously.
Pulse Width:  Changes the width of the square/pulse wave from a square 
wave when the pulse  width  knob is at its center position, to a very 
narrow pulse wave when the pulse  width  knob is fully left or right. 
Applying pulse width modulation using poly mod or the low frequency  oscillator  
is a great way to add movement and thickness to a sound, especially when creating 
pad or string-like sounds.
Sync:  Off, On —Turns on Oscillator A hard sync. Sync forces Oscillator 
A to restart its cycle every time Oscillator B starts a cycle. This provides 
a way to create more complex, harmonically rich shapes from simple 
waveforms—especially when the frequency of Oscillator A is set to a 
different interval than Oscillator B.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Oscillators
Use Poly Mod to sweep the pitch of Oscillator A when it is synced to generate 
the classic, hard-edged sync sound. See “Creating a Hard-Sync Lead” on page 51  
for more details.
Lo freq:  Off, On —Turns Oscillator B into a low-frequency oscillator, 
essentially providing another LFO source for modulation using Poly 
Mod. The frequency , fine, shape , and pulse  width  controls still apply and 
will affect the character of any low-frequency modulation applied using 
Oscillator B. 
Keyboard:  Off, On —When off, the Oscillator B ignores the keyboard 
and note data received via MIDI and plays at its base frequency setting. 
Oscillator B pitch can still be affected by modulation from other sources 
when in this mode. When keyboard  is off, the frequency  knob has a 9 
octave range.
To listen to the oscillators:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset .
2. In the basic program, only Oscillator A is turned up in the Mixer. Oscil -
lator A waveshape is set to sawtooth. The level of Oscillator B is set to 
zero.
3. Hold down a note on the keyboard and in the oscillators  section, 
toggle the sawtooth and square wave selectors on and off to hear the 
difference between the two separately, and in combination. 
4. Turn off the sawtooth wave and turn on the square wave. 
5. Turn the pulse  width  knob right and left to hear how the timbre of the 
waveform changes as you narrow its pulse width. At the 12 o’clock 
position the wave is perfectly square. At either extreme, the pulse width 
is so narrow that the sound becomes virtually inaudible.

SequentialTo listen to Oscillator B:
1. Turn down the level of Oscillator A in the Mixer and turn up the level 
of Oscillator B.
2. Turn on the triangle wave and listen to its sound. It has a very mellow 
sound because it has very few harmonics, unlike the sawtooth and 
square waves. 
3. Turn on the sawtooth wave and the square wave and notice how the 
sound changes.
4. Turn up Oscillator A again in the mixer. Notice how the sound becomes 
fuller now that you can hear both oscillators.
5. Experiment with using the fine knob on the Oscillator B to detune the 
oscillators in relation to each other. This creates movement and thick -
ness in their combined sound. 
6. Try using the frequency  knob of Oscillator B to tune Oscillator B to a 
interval such as a third, a fifth, or a sixth.
To sync Oscillator A to Oscillator B:
• With Oscillator A and B on, press the sync button on Oscillator A, and 
rotate its frequency  knob while you hold a note. 
This is the classic hard sync  sound that you’ve probably heard before. 
Instead of rotating the pitch  knob by hand, you can use Poly Mod to 
route the filter envelope to Oscillator A to sweep its pitch and create this 
effect each time you play a note. You’ll learn more about Poly Mod on 
page 34 . 


21
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Mixer
Mixer
The Mixer section is where you set the levels of the various sound gen -
erators on the Prophet-5. These include Oscillator A, Oscillator B, and 
the white noise generator. You must turn up at least one of these in order 
to make sound with the Prophet-5. (Alternatively, you can use the filter to 
generate its own sine wave in self-oscillating mode by turning Resonance 
to its maximum.)
   Rather than limit the Prophet-5’s outputs to keep the instrument from clipping, 
we allow you to adjust levels at various points in its signal path. This gives you the 
option to “overload” things in interesting ways, if you wish to do so. If not, try reducing 
the levels of the oscillators in the mixer  section, the sustain  parameter in the Amplifier 
Envelope, or the resonance  parameter in the filter.

Osc A:  Sets the output level of Oscillator A.
Osc B:  Sets the output level of Oscillator B.
Noise:  Sets the output level of the white noise generator.


22 Filter
SequentialFilter
The function of the filter is to subtract frequencies from the sound 
produced by the oscillators and noise generator, thereby changing the 
overall harmonic content of the synth’s sound. This change is varied over 
time using the Filter Envelope  to produce more dynamic timbres. 
The original Prophet-5 had three incarnations: the Rev1, Rev2, and Rev3, 
each with their own unique characteristics. Probably the most significant 
difference between the Rev 1/2 and the Rev3 was that they had different 
filters, which gave the instruments a different sound character. The Rev 
1/2 had a Dave Rossum-designed 2040 low-pass filter, while the Rev3 
had a Doug Curtis-designed CEM 3320 low-pass filter.
The new Prophet-5 provides the best of all worlds by providing both 
types of filters. You can select between these with the rev switch. Each 
has its own unique character:
• rev 1/2 is a Dave Rossum-designed SSI 2140 filter. Its 4-pole, 24 
dB-per-octave resonant design is functionally identical the 2040 filter 
found on the original Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 Rev1 and Rev2. It 
can self-oscillate when resonance  is set to its maximum.
• rev 3 is a genuine Doug Curtis-designed CEM 3320 filter. Its 4-pole, 24 
dB-per-octave resonant design is functionally identical the filter found 
on the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 Rev3. It can self-oscillate when 
resonance  is set to its maximum.
The differences between these filters can be subtle or pronounced, depend -
ing on their individual settings, the amount of filter resonance applied, 
and other factors. 
The rev switch not only changes filter type, but also the Filter Envelope’s shape/
response to match the original Prophet Rev 1/2 and Rev 3 respectively. After setting 
the Filter Envelope as desired, try changing filter type to hear the dif ference.


23
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Filter
The Filter
To hear the effect of the rev 1/2 filter:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset . 
The rev3 filter is selected by default. Switch to the Rev 1/2 filter by 
pressing the rev switch.
2. In the basic program, only Oscillator A is turned up in the Mixer. For 
a fuller sound, turn up Oscillator B in the Mixer, set its waveshape to 
sawtooth and detune it slightly by turning its fine knob to 2.
3. Hold down a note and rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob. Notice how it cuts 
the high frequencies as you rotate counter-clockwise, making the sound 
of the oscillator less bright. If you turn the cutoff  knob fully counter -
clockwise you’ll filter out all frequencies and hear nothing.
4. Return the cutoff  knob to its halfway position, hold down a note again 
then turn the resonance  knob about halfway up.
5. Rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob again and listen to the sound change as 
a band of frequencies near the cutoff is amplified. This how to create a 
classic resonant filter sweep.
To hear the effect of the rev 3 filter:
1. Press the rev switch to select rev 3 filter.
2. Hold down a note and rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob. Again it cuts the 
high frequencies as you rotate counter-clockwise, but the character of 
the filter is subtly different.

Sequential3. Return the cutoff  knob to its halfway position, hold down a note again 
then turn the resonance  knob about halfway up.
4. Rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob again and listen to the sound change as a 
band of frequencies near the cutoff is amplified.
5. Now toggle between the filters by pressing the rev switch and listen 
to the differences in tone. The differences become more apparent with 
higher and lower resonance settings.
In the previous examples, you controlled the filter cutoff by hand. In 
most cases, you will use the Filter Envelope to do this. To learn more 
about the Filter Envelope see page 25 .
Filter Controls 
Rev Switch: 1/2, 3 —This selects the filter type. The Rev 1/2 filter is a 
SSI 2140 low-pass, 4-pole, 24 dB per-octave resonant filter. The Rev 3 
filter is a Curtis CEM 3320 low-pass, 4-pole, 24 dB per-octave resonant 
filter. Both filters can self-oscillate when resonance  is set to its maximum.
Cutoff:  0...10 —Sets the filter’s cutoff frequency. 
Resonance:  0...10 —Emphasizes a narrow band of frequencies around 
the cutoff frequency. High levels of resonance can cause either filter to 
self-oscillate and generate its own pitch.
Envelope Amount:  0...10 —Sets the amount of modulation from the 
filter envelope to the filter’s cutoff frequency. Any setting above zero 
means that each time you strike a key, the filter envelope controls how 
the filter opens and closes. Higher amounts more dramatically affect the 
cutoff frequency.
Keyboard:  off, half, full —Sets the amount of modulation from the 
keyboard to the filter’s cutoff frequency. Selecting half or full means 
that the higher the note played on the keyboard, the more the filter opens. 
This is useful for adding brightness to a sound as higher notes are played, 
which is typically how acoustic instruments behave. If both half and full 
are off, keyboard filter tracking is off, meaning that filter frequency is unaf -
fected by playing higher or lower notes on the keyboard.


25
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Filter Envelope 
Filter Envelope 
The Prophet-5 filter has a dedicated, 4-stage envelope generator (attack, 
decay, sustain, release). The Filter Envelope is used to shape the 
harmonic characteristics of a synthesized sound by giving you filtering 
control with these stages. 
This is one of the most important aspects of a synthesized sound. With -
out an envelope, the filter would be static and unchanging. It would stay 
open or closed by a fixed amount that wouldn’t change over the duration 
of a sound. That’s not very expressive or interesting to listen to and it’s 
not how most real-world instruments behave. 
In general, sounds produced by an acoustic instrument are brighter at 
their beginning (the attack stage) and grow mellower as they die out 
(the decay and release stages). In other words, their harmonic content 
changes over time. This is exactly what the filter envelope is designed to 
emulate. 
The REV Switch Changes Filter Envelope Shape
The rev switch not only changes filter type, but also the Filter Enve -
lope’s shape/response to match the original Prophet Rev 1/2 or Rev 3 
respectively. 
The Rev 1/Rev 2 Prophet 5 used SSM envelope generators, and the basic 
shape was very flat, almost linear. The Rev 3 Prophet-5 used a Curtis 
envelope generator, and it had more of a curve than the SSM parts, so it 
had a slightly different sound. When you change the filter type with the 
rev switch, it also changes the Filter Envelope shape to match the SSM 
or Curtis parts, making the Prophet-5 sound authentic in both cases.

Attack:  0...10 —Sets the attack time of the envelope. The higher the 
setting, the slower the attack time and the longer it takes for the filter to 
open from the level set with the filter cutoff  knob to the level set by the 
filter envelope amount. Percussive sounds typically have sharp (short) 
attacks.
Decay:  0...10 —Sets the decay time of the envelope. After a sound 
reaches the filter frequency set at its attack stage, decay  controls how 
quickly the filter then transitions to the cutoff frequency set with the 
sustain  knob. The higher the setting, the longer the decay. Percussive 
sounds, such as synth bass, typically have shorter decays (and a generous 
amount of filter resonance).
Sustain:  0...10 —Sets the filter cutoff frequency for the sustained portion 
of the sound. The sound will stay at this filter frequency for as long as a 
note is held on the keyboard.
Release:  0...10 —Sets the release time of the envelope. This controls 
how quickly the filter closes after a note is released.
Velocity Switch: Filt, Amp —Allows key velocity to influence filter 
cutoff frequency and amplifier level (volume). When on, the harder you 
play, the more the filter will open and the brighter the sound will be. If 
off, key velocity will not affect the filter. This control allows for more 
touch-sensitive sounds.

1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset . 
The rev3 filter is selected by default.
2. Hold down a note and rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob to set it to 3.
3. Play a note. At this point you may not hear anything because you’ve 
closed the filter significantly.
4. Turn the envelope  amount  knob to 2. Play a note. Notice how the sound 
has changed. The Filter Envelope is controlling filter cutoff by the 
amount you set with the amount  knob.
5. Set the Filter Envelope’s sustain  to 0.
6. Repeatedly strike a note on the keyboard as you turn the Filter Enve -
lope’s decay  knob clockwise and counterclockwise. Notice how it 
changes the sound as the note decays faster or slower after its initial 
attack stage.
7. Now experiment with the Filter Envelope’s attack  knob. Notice how 
the attack becomes faster or slower. 
8. Now hold down a note and experiment with the Filter Envelope’s 
sustain  knob. This controls how wide the filter stays open while you 
hold down a key on the keyboard.
9. The Filter Envelope’s release  parameter acts in conjunction with the 
Amplifier Envelope, so to hear its effect, first set the Amp Envelope’s 
release  value to 6. 
10.  Now repeatedly strike a note on the keyboard as you turn the Filter 
Envelope’s release  knob clockwise and counterclockwise. Notice how 
the note fades out faster or slower as you change the release  value. 
11. Continue experimenting with various Filter Envelope settings while 
you adjust the Filter Envelope’s env amount  knob. Notice how greater 
amount  settings amplify the effect of the envelope on the filter.
As noted above, the Filter Envelope and Amplifier Envelope often work 
in conjunction, with the Filter Envelope controlling how the filter opens 
and closes and the Amplifier Envelope controlling how the Amplifier 
controls the overall volume shape of the sounds you create. To learn 
more about the Amplifier Envelope see page 28 . 
The release  switch affects the behavior of the Release stage of the Filter and  
Amplifier Envelopes. See “The Release Switch” on page 43 .


28 Amplifier Envelope
SequentialAmplifier Envelope
After passing through the filter, a synthesized sound goes into the 
Amplifier, which controls its overall volume. The Amplifier has a 
dedicated, 4-stage envelope generator (attack, decay, sustain, release) 
which is used to shape the volume characteristics of a sound over time by 
giving you control over these stages. Along with the filter envelope, this 
is one of the most important aspects of a synthesized sound. 
Without a volume envelope, the volume of a sound wouldn’t change 
over the duration of a note. It would begin immediately, remain at its full 
volume for its duration of the note, then end immediately when the note 
was released. Again, that’s not very interesting sonically and it’s not typi -
cally how instruments behave in the real world. 
To give you a real-world example, the main difference between the sound 
of the wind and the sound of a snare drum is that they have very different 
volume envelopes. Otherwise, they are essentially both white noise. 
Wind has a relatively slow attack, a long sustain, and a long decay and 
release. A snare drum has a sharp attack, no sustain, and very little decay 
or release. But again, they are both fundamentally white noise.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Low Frequency Oscillator
Low Frequency Oscillator
The LFO is a special-purpose oscillator that produces a frequency that is 
typically below the range of human hearing. The LFO is used for peri -
odic modulation such as vibrato (periodic pitch modulation) filter modu -
lation, and pulse-width modulation. The LFO can be routed to any or all 
of these destinations using the controls in the wheel -mod section.
The LFO produces three waveshapes: sawtooth, triangle, and square. 
Noise is also available as a modulation source in the wheel -mod section. 
The Low Frequency Oscillator and Wheel-Mod sections
Triangle wave is bipolar. That is, its waveshape is positive for half of its cycle 
and negative for the other half. This makes it possible to generate a vibrato 
that goes alternately sharp and flat in equal amounts on either side of a center 
frequency. The square and sawtooth waves generate only positive values. 
In the case of the square wave, this makes it possible to generate natural-
sounding trills.

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Wheel-Mod Controls
Using LFO and Wheel-Mod
There are many ways to make creative use of the LFO and Wheel-Mod:
• To create vibrato, route the LFO’s triangle wave to freq A and freq B 
in the wheel -mod section to create vibrato. Set the LFO frequency  to 
7 and the initial  amount  to 3. Make sure wheel -mod source  mix is set 
to fully counterclockwise to lfo. Using the Mod Wheel intensifies the 
effect.
• To create a chorusing effect, set osc a and osc b to sawtooth and set 
their levels equally in the mixer . Then the LFO’s triangle wave to just 
freq B with frequency  set to 2 and initial  amount  set to 3. Make sure 
wheel -mod source  mix is set to fully counterclockwise to lfo. Using the 
Mod Wheel intensifies the effect.
• To create trills, route the LFO’s square wave to freq A and freq B in 
the wheel -mod section. Set the frequency  to 6 and the initial  amount  to 
5. Make sure wheel -mod source  mix is set to fully counterclockwise to 
lfo. Using the Mod Wheel intensifies the effect.

34 Poly Mod
SequentialPoly Mod
Although the basic sonic character of the Prophet-5 is determined by its 
oscillators and filters, much of its power to make truly unique sounds 
comes from creative use of Poly Mod, or polyphonic modulation . Modu -
lation is the process of routing one parameter (used as a control voltage) 
to another parameter in order to change the way the targeted parameter 
behaves. 
In the case of the Prophet-5 you can use Osc B or the Filter Envelope 
Generator to modulate Oscillator A frequency, Oscillator A pulse width, 
or Filter cutoff frequency. And because there are five voices, this means 
that each voice applies modulation to the selected destination. 
For example, if you set Oscillator B to lo freq mode, this essentially 
creates five separate modulation LFOs since Osc B on each of the 
Prophet-5’s five voices then functions as a low frequency oscillator while 
in lo freq mode. If keyboard tracking is set to half or full, each of those 
oscillators/LFOs tracks the keyboard and has a different frequency. It’s a 
simple but powerful concept.
The Poly Mod section
Poly Mod modulation sources:
• Filter Envelope
• Oscillator B frequency
Poly Mod modulation destinations: 
• Oscillator A frequency
• Oscillator A pulse width (square wave)
• Filter cutoff frequency


35
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Poly Mod
You can control how much the source affects the destination by dialing in 
a specific modulation amount with the filter  env or osc b knobs.
Use Poly Mod to create complex harmonic effects ranging from FM 
(frequency modulation) to audio-rate filter modulation and beyond. Many 
classic sounds on the original Prophet-5 were created through clever use 
of Poly Mod.
Poly Mod Parameters
Filter Env: Selects the amount of modulation from the Filter Envelope 
that is applied to a selected destination.
Osc B: Selects the amount of modulation from Oscillator B that is 
applied to a selected destination. 
 When using osc b as a modulation source, the modulation character is 
affected by the waveshape currently chosen for Oscillator B (triangle, sawtooth, or 
square/pulse). Try setting Oscillator B to low frequency (using the lo freq switch) to 
further increase modulation possibilities.
Freq A:  Selects Oscillator A frequency as a modulation destination. 
Choose osc b as a modulation source to produce FM (frequency modu -
lation) effects with their characteristic complex harmonics and metallic 
timbre. 
PW A:  When Oscillator A is set to square wave, choosing this as a desti -
nation modulates its pulse width. This will animate the timbre of Oscillator 
A in interesting ways. 
Filter:  Selects the Filter cutoff frequency as a modulation destination.


36 Using the Vintage Knob
SequentialUsing the Vintage Knob
The new Prophet-5 is an authentically vintage-sounding instrument even 
though it was designed and constructed with state-of-the-art technology 
and components. Part of the reason for this is that it uses genuine analog 
voltage-controlled oscillators, filters, and amplifiers that are as exact as 
possible to the versions used in the original Prophet-5. 
Another reason for the vintage sound of the new Prophet-5 is that we did 
extensive research into exactly what made the original sound the way it 
did — warm, organic, and alive. Not surprisingly we found that much of 
this desirable character was due to slight fluctuations and differences in 
the response times and frequencies of the individual filters, envelopes, 
and amplifiers from voice to voice.
To impart the same flavor to the new Prophet-5, we created a control, the 
vintage  knob, that lets you dial in progressively more of this character as 
you go from a very stable 4 (as in Prophet-5 Rev4 , which is how we refer 
to the new Prophet-5) all the way to 1 (as in Prophet-5 Rev1 , which was 
the rarest and most temperamental of all Prophet-5s).  
Thus, turning the vintage  knob from 4 to 1 adds progressively more 
randomness to the behavior of the individual VCOs, filters, envelopes, 
and amplifiers. 
Try it out!

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Pitch and Mod Wheels
Pitch and Mod Wheels
The Prophet-5 has a spring-loaded Pitch wheel and a Mod wheel. You 
can use these controls to enhance live performance by bending notes and 
adding modulation in real time as you play. 
PITCH MOD
The Pitch and Modulation wheels
Pitch Wheel
The Pitch wheel allows for a broad range of effects from subtle vibrato, 
to half or whole-step note bends, to full-on guitar whammy bar-style  
bends. By default its range is set to a semitone (a half step) but you can 
change this on a per-program basis to up to an octave.
To use the Pitch wheel:
1. Hold a note and move the Pitch wheel up or down. The farther you 
move the wheel from center, the wider the pitch variation.
2. For a vibrato effect, try rocking the Pitch wheel back and forth.
To set the Pitch wheel bend range for a specific program:
1. Press and hold the freq a button in the wheel -mod section.
2. Use the group  select  (decrement) and bank  select  (increment) 
switches to choose the desired range from 1- 12. A setting of 1 equals a 
semitone. A setting of 12 equals an octave.


38 Adding Aftertouch
SequentialMod Wheel
The Mod wheel controls the amount of modulation from the LFO and/or the 
Noise source as set in the wheel -mod section. This allows you to perform 
modulation in real time by moving the wheel as you play. It’s a great way to 
add expressiveness to a sound or performance by using it to control vibrato, 
filter effects, and more. 
To choose a modulation destination for the Mod wheel:
1. In the wheel -mod section, select the destination(s) for modulation from 
the LFO/Noise source. The destination  switches allow you to activate 
multiple destinations simultaneously.
2. Using the source  mix knob, set the source of modulation applied by the 
Mod wheel.
3. For LFO modulation, set the shape  and frequency . 
4. To apply modulation only when you use the Mod wheel, set the initial  
amount  to 0.
5. Hold down a note on the keyboard and turn the Mod wheel. 
Adding Aftertouch
Aftertouch is a performance feature that allows you to add modulation to 
a sound by applying additional pressure to a key after the key is already 
down. The greater the pressure applied, the more modulation is applied. 
The Prophet-5 provides monophonic  (or “channel”) aftertouch, which 
means that applying pressure to any key within a chord will apply modu -
lation to all notes currently held.
The aftertouch  switch  lets you choose to apply aftertouch to the Filter 
cutoff and/or the LFO amount. 


39
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Glide Rate
In the case of Filter aftertouch, pressing a key harder will open the filter 
wider, increasing the brightness of the sound. In the case of LFO modula -
tion, pressing a key harder will apply modulation to the currently enabled 
destinations in the wheel -mod section.
To enable aftertouch (pressure) as a source for modulation:
1. Press the aftertouch  switch once to select Filter modulation.
2. Press the aftertouch  switch twice to select LFO modulation.
3. Press the aftertouch  switch three times to select both Filter modulation 
and LFO modulation.
4. Hold down a note on the keyboard, then press harder.  Modulation is 
applied to the selected destination(s).
 The Prophet-5 provides eight different aftertouch/pressure response settings. 
To choose a different response curve, use the at response  parameter in the globals  
parameters. See page 16  for more information.
Glide Rate
Glide causes the pitch of a note to glide up or down from the pitch of 
the previously played note. On the Prophet-5, glide operates on a given 
voice whenever that voice changes to a different note. It functions when the 
Prophet-5 is in either polyphonic or Unison mode.
To use Glide:
1. Turn the glide  rate knob to approximately 4. 
2. Play a series of notes up and down the keyboard while you continue to 
turn the glide  rate knob to adjust the amount of glide. 


40 Unison
SequentialUnison
When unison  is on, the Prophet-5 functions like a monophonic 
synthesizer in that only 1 note can be played at a time. However, that one 
note can be powered by as many as five voices, depending on how many 
you choose to use. 
With up to 10 oscillators powering a single note (2 oscillators per voice 
x 5 voices), you can create some very dense, speaker-rattling sounds. 
Unison gives you control over how many voices to stack, and also the 
amount of detuning between the oscillators.
UNISON
To use Unison:
1. Press and hold the unison  swit ch. 
2. With the unison  switch held down, use the group  select  (decrement) 
and bank  select  (increment) switches to choose the number of voices 
to stack, then release the Unison switch.
To detune the oscillators in Unison:
1. Press and hold the unison  swit ch. 
2. With the unison  switch held down, use the program  select  switches 
to set the amount of detuning. A setting of 0 is minimum detuning. A 
setting of 8 is maximum detuning.


41
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Unison
If you want to create an ultra heavy synth bass, try using Unison!
 By default, the Prophet-5 has last-note priority, meaning that when you play 
more keys on the keyboard than are available as voices, the last notes played take 
priority and will “steal” previous notes/voices. When using Unison mode, you can 
change this to other key priority modes. See “Note Priority Modes” on page 45 .
Using Chord Memory
Unison has another useful feature: chord memory. Instead of assigning 
voices to a single note, hold down a chord on the keyboard and press the 
unison  switch. The Prophet-5 memorizes the notes of the chord. Single 
notes played on the keyboard will then trigger all notes of the stored 
chord, transposing them as you play up or down the keyboard. Try using 
this feature to create powerful chord stabs. 
If you save a program that uses chord memory, the chord is saved with 
the program. “ CHO” will then appear as a choice if you step through 
voice stacking options using the group  select  and bank  select  buttons 
while holding down unison . 
To use chord memory:
1. Hold down a chord on the keyboard (5 notes maximum).
2. Press the unison  switch. The chord voicing is memorized. Play a few 
notes to listen to the result.
3. If you save the program, the unison chord memory is saved with it.
To clear chord memory:
1. Turn off Unison. 
2. Hold down a single note.
3. Press the unison  button.
4. Save the program again.
Alternatively, with the unison  switch held down, use the group  select  
(decrement) and bank  select  (increment) switches to choose a specific 
number of voices to stack (instead of “ CHD” ).


42 Master Tune
SequentialMaster Tune
The master  tune control allows you to manually tune the Prophet-5 
to the A440 reference tone or to an external reference such as another 
instrument. It has a tuning range of approximately a semitone (half step) 
sharp or flat. This knob has a center detente, and when in the center posi -
tion, the Prophet-5 should be at concert pitch.
The Master Tune and A440 reference tone controls
To manually tune the Prophet-5 to A440:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset .
2. Hold down an “A” in the middle of the keyboard.
3. Press the a440 switch. The Prophet-5 generates an A440 reference 
tone. 
4. Turn the master  tune knob until you match the pitch of the  A440 
reference tone.
5. When you’re done, press the a440 switch again to turn off the refer -
ence tone.


43
Prophet-5 User’s Guide The Release Switch
The Release Switch
The release  switch affects the behavior of the Filter and Amplifier Enve -
lopes. The original Prophet-5 had a different way of handling Release 
from the more common method used today. If the release  switch is on, 
the release  knob setting on the Filter and Amplifier envelopes is used. If 
the release  switch is off, the Release on both envelopes is fast.
If you then connect a footswitch, it acts somewhat like a piano: it’s 
a quick release when the footswitch is not pressed, and it’s a longer 
(programmed by the knob) release when the footswitch is held. Note that 
the release  switch needs to be off for the footswitch to operate this way. 
Since this is, after all, a Prophet-5, we wanted it to match the original 
synth. These days, however, many musicians expect the footswitch to be 
a “hold” function, which is of course different than the Prophet-5 release  
switch behavior. So, we added a Global parameter that allows you to 
select the original Prophet-5 method, or a more common hold function 
with the footswitch.
Use the release /sustain  parameter in globals  row two ( program  select  
2) to choose between classic Prophet-5 Release handling ( rEL) or the 
more contemporary Hold method ( HLd). 
The Release switch


44 The Tune Button
SequentialThe Tune Button
The tune button runs an auto-calibration procedure on the Prophet-5, 
tuning its oscillators, filters, and other components. Use this calibration 
procedure as needed over the first few days of use. The Prophet-5 learns 
the range of temperatures at your location and will keep itself in tune 
over this range. 
Later, if you use the Prophet-5 in a different environment that is measur -
ably warmer or cooler (on stage, in an air-conditioned studio, and so on) 
run the calibration procedure again.
Please be aware that it’s possible for the Prophet-5’s oscillators and filter 
to be in tune with themselves but for the synthesizer to not be tuned to 
concert pitch. Master tuning of the synth is controlled by the master  
tune knob. See page 42  for details.
To calibrate the oscillators and filters:
1. Press the tune button.  
2. The program select  button  LEDs begin flashing in sequence and the 
numeric display indicates the tuning sequence while the Prophet-5 
performs its auto-calibration procedure. Don’t turn off the power while 
it’s doing this.
3. When finished, the front panel controls return to normal and you can 
play the Prophet-5.


45
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Key Priority Modes
Key Priority Modes
Key Priority determines what key has priority when Unison mode is on 
and more than one key is pressed at the same time. When played poly -
phonically, the Prophet-5 is set to last note priority so that any newly 
played notes take priority and will “steal” voices when necessary .  
Available key priority modes are:
• Low note priority ( LO) gives priority to the lowest note played.
• Low note retrigger ( LOr) causes the envelopes to be retriggered with 
each keystroke.
• Last note priority ( Las) gives priority to the last note played. 
• Last note priority retrigger ( LAr gives priority to the last note played 
and retriggers the envelopes with each keystroke.
To set the Key Priority Mode:
1. Press and hold the keyboard  swit ch in the oscillator  b section. 
2. Use the group  select  (decrement) and bank  select  (increment) 
switches to choose the desired note priority mode (low, last, low retrig -
ger, last retrigger).
About Voice Assignment
There are a number of different aspects of voice assignment on the 
Prophet-5. The method on the original was simple, and we implemented 
it: when you hold more than five notes, it will steal one of the voices 
to play the next note, and it will retrigger. Another aspect is that if you 
repeatedly hit the same key, it will not cycle through voices; it will 
retrigger the same voice. 
In Unison mode, the original Prophet-5 would always play all five voices 
(now you can stack 1-5 voices), it would always be low-note priority, 
and it would always play legato; that is, it would not retrigger on a new 
key unless all keys were released first.
The additional Key Priority modes described above allow you to use 
alternate trigger and voice assignment methods for Unison. These modes 
do not affect polyphonic playing.  


46 Chapter 3: Creating Sounds
SequentialChapter 3: Creating Sounds
The Prophet-5 can produce a broad spectrum of sounds. Though the 
factory programs give you some idea of its scope, if you just play its presets, 
you’re not using the Prophet-5 to its full potential. The real fun is in creating 
sounds of your own. 
This chapter provides some short sound programming tutorials. Though 
there isn’t enough space here to cover how to use every Prophet-5 function, 
the examples will help you get familiar with some basic concepts. 
Synth Bass
A synth bass is one of the easiest and most useful sounds you can make 
on a synth. Many great synth bass sounds consist of a single oscillator, a 
bit of filter resonance, the proper envelope, and that’s it. So start with the 
Basic Program and go from there.  
Short Version
To create a classic synth bass:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset . 
2. Set filter cutoff  to 3.
3. Set filter resonance  to 3.
4.  In the envelopes  section, set the Filter Envelope’s decay  to 6.
5. In the envelopes  section, set the Filter Envelope’s sustain  to 2.
6. In the envelopes  section, set the Filter Envelope’s env amount  to 10. 
7. Play some low notes on the keyboard. Instant synth bass!
8. Experiment with the Filter Envelope’s env amount  and decay  settings.
9. Experiment with the Filter’s resonance  settings.


47
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Synth Bass
Long Version
Here’s a more detailed version that provides insight into the process. 
You’ll start with the Basic Program, then learn how to choose an appro -
priate oscillator waveshape, how to use the filter, how to use the enve -
lopes, and how to use Unison to fatten things up.
In the Basic Program, only Oscillator A is audible. Its waveshape is set 
to sawtooth and its level is 10 in the mixer . (Oscillator B is set to 0 in the 
Mixer and no wave shape is selected.)
To start with the Basic Program:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset .
Each of the waveforms have their own unique sound: 
• The sawtooth waveform is a good starting point for sounds because it 
has plenty of harmonics. This gives you a lot to work with in terms of a 
raw sound that you can filter and modulate.
• The pulse (square) wave is a good starting point, too, but sounds 
different than the sawtooth, because of its different harmonic content. 
The sawtooth has even-numbered harmonics and the square wave has 
odd-numbered harmonics. (Perform a web search on this if you want to 
learn more.) 
• The triangle wave (Oscillator B only) has very few harmonics. It’s 
useful used alone for its pure tone, or in combination with another 
oscillator to reinforce the fundamental pitch of a sound and add weight. 
Next, you’ll use the filter to shape the raw sound of the sawtooth wave.  
To adjust the filter:
1. Press and hold down a key and turn the filter’s cutoff  knob. Notice 
how it cuts the high frequencies as you rotate counter-clockwise, 
making the sound of the oscillator less bright. If you turn the cutoff  
knob fully counterclockwise you’ll filter out all frequencies and hear 
nothing.
2. Return the cutoff  knob to 3 and the turn the Filter Envelope’s envelope  
amount  knob to a value of 5.


48 Synth Bass
Sequential3. In the envelopes  section, set the Filter Envelope’s decay  to 6.
4. In the envelopes  section, set the Filter Envelope’s sustain  to 2.
5. Repeatedly play a note as you turn the resonance  knob to 6. Notice 
how the sound changes as a band of frequencies near the cutoff is 
amplified.
6. Rotate the filter’s cutoff  knob again and you’ll hear a classic resonant 
filter sweep. You’re going to use this to create your synth bass.
7. Set the filter cutoff  to a value of 3.
8. Set the filter resonance  to a value of 3. This is going to give the synth 
bass its funky “zap.”
9. Play a note and listen to the sound. At this point you won’t hear much 
because you’ve mostly closed the filter. You’ll need to open the filter 
wider using the Filter Envelope (so you don’t have to turn the cutoff  
knob by hand).
To adjust the filter envelope:
1. In the Envelopes section, turn the Filter Envelope’s envelope  amount  
knob to a value of 10. 
2. Play a low note on the keyboard. Instant synth bass!
3. If you want, set the frequency of Oscillator A and Oscillator B an 
octave lower using the frequency  knob.
Notice how the sound has changed. The Filter Envelope is controlling 
filter cutoff by the amount you set with the amount  knob.
4. Continue experimenting with the Filter Envelope’s amount  knob. 
Notice how greater amount  settings amplify the effect of the envelope 
on the filter.
5. Repeatedly strike a note on the keyboard as you turn the Filter Enve -
lope’s decay  knob clockwise and counterclockwise. Notice how it 
changes the sound as the note decays faster or slower.
Be aware that the Filter Envelope and Amplifier Envelope work in 
conjunction, with the Filter Envelope controlling how the filter opens and 
closes and the Amplifier Envelope controlling the overall volume shape. 
To learn more about the Amplifier Envelope, see page 28 . 


49
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Synth Bass
6. The Filter Envelope’s release  parameter acts in conjunction with the 
Amplifier Envelope. In other words, you can’t hear a long release on 
the filter envelope if the amplifier envelope is short! So to hear the filter 
envelope’s release  parameter in action, first set the Amp Envelope’s 
release  value to 7. 
7. Now repeatedly strike a note on the keyboard as you turn the Filter 
Envelope’s release  knob clockwise and counterclockwise. Notice how 
the note fades out faster or slower as you change the release  value. 
How to make the synth bass fatter:
• Turn on the square wave in Oscillator A.
• Turn up Oscillator B in the mixer, then turn on the sawtooth wave and 
use the fine control to slightly detune oscillator B.
• Turn on unison  then increase voice stacking by holding down the 
unison  button and repeatedly pressing the bank  select  button until it 
says 5.
• Detune the stacked unison voices by holding down the unison  button 
and press one of the program  select  buttons (maximum detuning is 8).
Now you know how to create a simple synth bass program using the 
most essential synthesizer components of the Prophet-5: the oscillators, 
the filters, and the envelopes. Using just these three things you can create 
an enormous variety of sounds. Keep experimenting with them and if 
you like what you’ve created, save the programs in one of the user banks. 
(See “Saving a Program” on page 9 .)


50 Creating Synth Brass
SequentialCreating Synth Brass
Here’s another easy-to-construct sound: synth brass, with a classic “pitch 
blip” effect on the attack. In this example you’ll learn how to use Poly 
Mod to modulate the pitch of Oscillator A to simulate an aggressively 
blown horn effect.
To create synth brass:
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset . 
Oscillator A is set to sawtooth by default. 
2. Turn up Oscillator B in the mixer, then turn on its sawtooth wave and 
set the fine control to 2 to detune it slightly.
3. In the filter  section, set cutoff  to 1, resonance  to 3, and filter  amount  
to 8.
4. Press the keyboard  switch twice to set keyboard filter tracking to full.
5. In the filter  envelope  section, set the attack  to 4, decay  to 6, sustain  to 
4, and release  to 0. 
6. Enable touch sensitivity by pressing and enabling the velocity  button 
once.
7. Play a few chords. Basic synth brass!
8. If you want, set the frequency of Oscillator A and Oscillator B an 
octave lower using the frequency  knob.
To create the “pitch blip”:
1. In the Poly Mod section, turn on freq a. This will route the modulation 
to the frequency of Oscillator A.
2. As you repeatedly play a chord, gradually turn up the filt env knob. 
This sets the amount of modulation from the Filter Envelope to the 
frequency of Oscillator A. The exact shape of the Filter Envelope 
determines the rise and fall of the frequency. This create the slight pitch 
variation at the beginning of the sound (the “pitch blip”). 
3. Set the filt env to somewhere between 0 and 1.
4. In the filter  envelope  section, experiment with different values for the 
decay  parameter. The controls how quickly the pitch falls. 
5. Play some notes in the upper range of the keyboard. Classic synth 
brass!

Oscillator A is set to sawtooth by default. 
2. On Oscillator A, enable the sync button. (See page 20  for an expla -
nation of hard sync.) 
3. Set Oscillator A frequency  to 4. This will allow for a wide range of

8. In the filter  envelope  section, set attack  to 4, decay  to 7, sustain  to 4, 
and release  to 5. This will set the “shape” of the modulation.
9. Play some notes. Classic hard-sync lead!
10.  Experiment with the Filter Envelope’s Attack, Decay, Sustain, and 
Release settings to better understand how these affect the shape of pitch 
modulation routed to Oscillator 1.

A Final Word
The examples provided are pretty basic, but they give you some idea of 
the power of synthesis. Imagine what you can create by experimenting 
more with the oscillators, filter, envelopes, LFOs, and Poly Mod.
It’s often useful to start with a simple sound and make it progressively 
more complex, saving edited versions as you go so that you can retrace 
your steps and branch off at different points in the sound design process 
if you want. Enjoy exploring the Prophet-5!

Prophet-5 User’s Guide Chapter 4: Using CVs and Gates
Chapter 4: Using CVs and Gates
This chapter explains how to connect the Prophet-5’s Control V oltage inputs 
and outputs and Gate in and out to external devices such as a modular 
synthesizer.
Using Prophet-5’s CV Out
The Prophet-5 can interface with a modular synthesizer and other devices 
with control voltage ins and outs through its CV input and output . In the 
example below, the Prophet-5 keyboard is used to play the oscillator of 
a modular synth. Note that CV output tracks the last note played on the 
Prophet-5.
To use the Prophet-5’s CV Outs to control the oscillator of a modular 
synth:
1. Using a ¼ inch patch cable, connect the Prophet-5’s CV Out to the 
appropriate CV In on the modular synth’s oscillator module. (The 
modular synth’s input should support a 1-volt-per-octave signal.)
2. Play the Prophet-5 keyboard. The modular synth’s oscillator should 
respond to the notes. (You may need to tune the modular synth’s oscil -
lators to match the Prophet-5’s oscillators.)
Adjusting the Prophet-5’s CV Output Scaling:
The Prophet-5 is calibrated at the factory so that low C on the keyboard 
produces 0v at the CV Out and high C produces 5v. Depending on the 
device you wish to control using the Prophet-5’s CV Out, you may need 
to make slight adjustments to these voltages in order for the target device 
to track pitch accurately across the full range of the Prophet-5 keyboard.
Adjusting CV Output scaling:
1. Connect the Prophet-5’s CV Out to the CV In of an external oscillator 
or synthesizer using a standard ¼ inch TS patch cable.

octaves above the Low Point pitch.
9. Press program  select  button 8 to exit CV Calibration Mode .
Adjusting the Prophet-5’s CV Input Scaling:
The Prophet-5 is calibrated at the factory so that 0v received at the rear-
panel cv in jack will produce the same pitch as the lowest C note on the 
instrument’s keyboard, and 5v will produce the highest C note. Depend -
ing on the device you wish to use to control one voice of the Prophet-5 
from the CV Input, you may need to make slight adjustments to these 
voltage points in order for your controlling device to cause the Prophet-5 
to produce the correct pitch. Some devices may not produce perfect V olt/
Oct voltage scaling, but the Prophet-5 can accommodate.
Adjusting CV Input scaling:
1. Connect the CV Out of the controlling device to the Prophet-5’s rear-
panel cv in jack using a standard ¼ inch TS patch cable.
2. Connect the Gate Out of the controlling device to the Prophet-5’s gate 
in using a standard ¼ inch TS patch cable.

switches to make negative or positive adjustments to the CV In Low 
Point, bringing the Prophet-5’s pitch to “C”. The Prophet-5’s CV Input 
is quantized to semitones, so the pitch will jump abruptly as you make 
the adjustment, rather than change gradually.
8. Press program  select  button 4 to begin adjusting the CV In High Point.
9. Repeat steps 5-7. The target pitch for the CV Out High Point is “C” 
five octaves above the Low Point pitch.

Using Prophet-5’s Gate In and Gate Out
The Prophet-5 can interface with a gear that accepts gate in or gate out 
signals for envelope triggering. 
Note that Prophet-5 Gate Out signals are output from the Prophet-5 
keyboard each time a key is pressed. Note also that when a jack is 
inserted into the Prophet-5’s rear-panel gate in jack, voice 5 is no longer 
available to play from the keyboard and will instead be triggered by the 
external gate signal.
The Prophet-5’s gate in is tolerant of voltages up to 15v, but any positive 
voltage above 1.7v will gate its envelopes.
To use the Prophet-5’s Gate Out:
1. Using a ¼ inch patch cable, connect the Prophet-5’s Gate Out to the 
appropriate Gate In on the external device 
2. Play the Prophet-5 keyboard. The external device should respond to the 
Prophet-5 envelope triggers each time you strike a key.
To use the Prophet-5’s Gate In:
1. Using a ¼ inch patch cable, connect the Prophet-5’s Gate In to the 
appropriate Gate Out on the external device. 
2. Play the external device. The Prophet-5 should respond to the Gate 
signal of the external device. As noted above, voice 5 is no longer 
available to play from the keyboard and will instead be triggered by the 
external gate signal.

Troubleshooting
If you’re experiencing problems or unexpected behavior from your 
Prophet-5, here are a few typical scenarios and their solutions:
If the Prophet-5 isn’t producing sound: .
1. Recall the basic preset by holding down record  and pressing preset .
2. If the problem is still there, check the following:
• V olume - make sure it is set to an appropriate value
• Rear-panel output jacks - make your audio cables are connected to audio  out. 
• In the globals  section, make sure that local  ctrl is set to on.
If some of the programs sound different than usual:
• In the globals  section, check scale /alt tuning  and make sure it’s set to 
NOL. Also, check the Mod wheel position. The Mod wheel can do more 
than just add vibrato and maybe be affecting filter cutoff.
If there is a ground hum in the audio output:
• USB can cause ground loops, so try to resolve any grounding issues 
between the computer (if connected) and the Prophet-5. Or use MIDI, 
which is opto-isolated.
If the Prophet-5 is behaving erratically:
• This is almost always caused by a MIDI feedback loop. Make sure 
that any MIDI Thru functionality is turned off on the MIDI interface/
hardware or in the MIDI software application. Disconnect all Prophet-5 
MIDI connections (MIDI and USB cables) and see if the problem 
persists. You can also monitor the MIDI traffic with MIDI Monitor  
(Mac OS) or MIDI-OX  (Windows) to see if the Prophet-5 is being 
overrun with duplicate messages.


58 Appendix A: Troubleshooting and Support
SequentialIf the Prophet-5 doesn’t seem to respond to its controls:
• Make sure local  ctrl is on in the globals  section.
If MIDI System Exclusive data is not transmitted/received:
• Make sure that the midi sysex  cable  setting in the globals  section is set 
to usb or midi depending on which you are using to transmit or receive 
MIDI messages.
If the Prophet-5 plays out of tune:
• Check the transpose  parameter in the globals  menu to make sure it is 
set to 0.
• Check the master  tune knob to make sure it is set to 0.
• Set the vintage  knob to 4.
• Check the alt tuning  parameter in the globals  menu to make sure it is 
set to normal ( NOL ).
• You may need to recalibrate the oscillators. See “Calibrating the VCOs 
and Filters” on page 5 .
If the pitch or Mod wheel doesn’t go to full range:
• Recalibrate the Pitch and Mod wheels. See “Calibrating the Pitch and 
Mod Wheels” on page 61 .
If the filter sounds strange or out of tune:
• You may need to recalibrate the filters. See “Calibrating the Oscillators 
and Filters” on page 5 .
• Set the vintage  knob to 4.

Appendix B: Calibrating the Prophet-5
The first time you use the Prophet-5, please run its built-in calibration 
procedure. The Prophet-5 learns the range of temperatures at your loca -
tion and will keep itself in tune over this range. 
Later, if you use the Prophet-5 in a different environment that is measur -
ably warmer or cooler (on stage, in an air-conditioned studio, and so on) 
run the calibration procedure again.
Calibrating the VCOs and Filters
To calibrate the oscillators and filters:
1. Press the tune button.  
2. The program select  button  LEDs begin flashing in sequence and the 
numeric display indicates the tuning sequence while the Prophet-5 
performs its auto-calibration procedure. Don’t turn off the power while 
it’s doing this.
When finished, the front panel controls return to normal and you can play 
the Prophet-5. 
Calibrating the Pitch and Mod Wheels

porting Programs/Banks
You can use the pgm dump  command in the globals  section  to transmit the 
current program, the current bank, the current group, all user banks, or 
all banks (both user and factory) in SysEx format via the selected MIDI 
port. 
This allows you to save your programs so that you can share them or 
archive them. Dumped programs will load back into the same bank and 
program location in memory when received by the Prophet-5 via MIDI. 
Make sure that your MIDI Editor or Librarian application of choice is open 
and ready for data transfer and that you have made the necessary MIDI/USB 
connections between the Prophet-5 and your computer.
To export a Program, Bank, Group, or all Banks as a SysEx file over 
MIDI:
1. Press the globals  button  once (this enables the upper set of parameters) 
then press program  selector  6 to select the midi sysex  command.  
2. Use the group  select  and bank  select  buttons to select the appropriate 
MIDI port — MIDI ( MID) or USB (usb).

1. Connect your Prophet-5 to a computer using a USB cable (or MIDI 
cable, if you are using a dedicated MIDI interface). 
2. Press the globals  button on your Prophet-5 and press  program  select 
button 6 (MIDI SysEx).
3. Use the group  select  and bank  select  buttons to choose either usb 
or midi, depending on which port you are using to connect to your 
computer.
4. Press the globals  button twice to exit the Global parameters.
5. Open your MIDI librarian software and configure it to send SysEx 
messages to your Prophet-5.
6. In the MIDI librarian, open the programs and/or banks you want to send. 
7. Transmit the programs. The Prophet-5 should load them. They will 
replace any existing programs in those same memory locations on the 
synth. 
Programs will load back into the same Group, Bank, and Program locations 
from which they were originally exported.


64 Appendix D: Alternative Tunings
SequentialAppendix D: Alternative Tunings
By default, the Prophet-5 is set to standard, chromatic western tuning. 
Additionally, it supports up to 16 additional alternative tunings, which 
you can access using the alt tuning  parameter in the globals  section.   
These 16 alternative tunings range from Equal temperament to Indo -
nesian Gamelan tunings. If you want, you can replace these with other 
tunings that you can find on the Internet. These must be in SysEx format. 
You can download them into the Prophet-5 using SysEx Librarian for 
Mac or MIDI-OX for Windows.
Here are descriptions of the alternative tunings.
1. 12-Tone Equal Temperament (non-erasable)
The default Western tuning, based on the twelfth root of two.  
2. Harmonic Series
MIDI notes 36-95 reflect harmonics 2 through 60 based on the funda -
mental of A = 27.5 Hz. The low C on a standard 5 octave keyboard acts 
as the root note (55Hz), and the harmonics play upwards from there. The 
remaining keys above and below the 5 octave range are filled with the 
same intervals as Carlos’ Harmonic 12 Tone that follows.
3. Carlos Harmonic Twelve Tone
Wendy Carlos’ twelve note scale based on octave-repeating harmonics. 
A = 1/1 (440 Hz). 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 21/16 11/8 3/2 13/8 27/16 7/4 
15/8
4. Meantone Temperament
An early tempered tuning, with better thirds than 12ET. Sounds best in 
the key of C. Use this to add an authentic touch to performances of early 
Baroque music. C=1/1 (260 Hz)
5. 1/4 Tone Equal Temperament
24 notes per octave, equally spaced 24root2 intervals. Mexican composer 
Julian Carillo used this for custom-built pianos in the early 20th century.


65
Prophet-5 User’s Guide Appendix D: Alternative Tunings
6. 19 Tone Equal Temperament
19 notes per octave (19root2) offering better thirds than 12 ET, a better 
overall compromise if you can figure out the keyboard patterns.
7. 31 Tone Equal Temperament
Many people consider 31root2 to offer the best compromise towards just 
intonation in an equal temperament, but it can get very tricky to keep 
track of the intervals.
8. Pythagorean C
One of the earliest tuning systems known from history, the Pythagorean 
scale is constructed from an upward series of pure fifths (3/2) transposed 
down into a single octave. The tuning works well for monophonic melo -
dies against fifth drones, but has a very narrow palate of good chords 
to choose from. C=1/1 (261.625 Hz) 1/1 256/243 9/8 32/27 81/64 4/3 
729/512 3/2 128/81 27/16 16/9 243/128
9. Just Intonation in A with 7-Limit Tritone at D#
A rather vanilla 5-limit small interval JI, except for a single 7/5 tritone 
at D#, which offers some nice possibilities for rotating around bluesy 
sevenths. A=1/1 (440 Hz) 1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 7/5 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8
10. 3-5 Lattice in A
A pure 3 and 5-limit tuning which resolves to very symmetrical derived 
relationships between notes. A=1/1 (440 Hz) 1/1 16/15 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 
64/45 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8
11. 3-7 Lattice in A
A pure 3 and 7-limit tuning which resolves to very symmetrical derived 
relationships between notes. Some of the intervals are very close 
together, offering several choices for the same nominal chords. A=1/1 
(440 Hz) 1/1 9/8 8/7 7/6 9/7 21/16 4/3 3/2 32/21 12/7 7/4 63/32
12. Other Music 7-Limit Black Keys in C
Created by the group Other Music for their homemade gamelan, this 
offers a wide range of interesting chords and modes. C=1/1 (261.625 Hz) 
1/1 15/14 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 7/5 3/2 14/9 5/3 7/4 15/8


66 Appendix D: Alternative Tunings
Sequential13. Dan Schmidt Pelog/Slendro
Created for the Berkeley Gamelan group, this tuning fits an Indonesian-
style heptatonic Pelog on the white keys and pentatonic Slendro on the 
black keys, with B and Bb acting as 1/1 for their respective modes. Note 
that some of the notes will have the same frequency. By tuning the 1/1 to 
60 Hz, Dan found a creative way to incorporate the inevitable line hum 
into his scale. Bb, B = 1/1 (60 Hz) 1/1 1/1 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 3/2 
7/4 7/4 15/8
14. Yamaha Just Major C
When Yamaha decided to put preset microtunings into their FM synth 
product line, they selected this and the following tuning as representative 
just intonations. As such, they became the de-facto introduction to JI for 
many people. Just Major gives preferential treatment to major thirds on 
the sharps, and a good fourth relative to the second. C= 1/1 (261.625) 1/1 
16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8
15. Yamaha Just Minor C
Similar to Yamaha’s preset Just Major, the Just Minor gives preferential 
treatment to minor thirds on the sharps, and has a good fifth relative to 
the second. C= 1/1 (261.625) 1/1 25/24 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 
5/3 16/9 15/8
16. Harry Partch 11-Limit 43 Note Just Intonation
One of the pioneers of modern microtonal composition, Partch built 
a unique orchestra with this tuning during the first half of the 20th 
century, to perform his own compositions. The large number of intervals 
in this very dense scale offers a full vocabulary of expressive chords 
and complex key changes. The narrow spacing also allows fixed-
pitched instruments like marimbas and organs to perform glissando-like 
passages. G = 1/1 (392 Hz, MIDI note 67)
