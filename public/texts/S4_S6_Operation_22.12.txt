Faster session caching - Opening and Closing
Assigning parameters to Knobs for Local or Attention Zones

Enable Exclude Inactive Tracks to improve session caching time. When 
enabled, S4 S6 will not load inactive tracks from the Pro Tools session. 
Especially with large sessions containing numerous inactive tracks, this 
option can provide a signiﬁcant improvement in performance.

The preference for Number of Knobs per Plugin can 
be limited to increase the performance for plug-ins with very large numbers of pagetable parameters such as Virtual Instruments.
Decreasing the number of parameter 
knobs that S6 has to refresh will increase 
the surface performance.
