Part I: Introduction


Chapter 1: Introduction to Avid | S6 and S4 1Chapter 1: Introduction to Avid | S6 and S4
Avid™ S6 and S4 are modular, ergonomica lly designed control surfaces for Pro Tools® Software and EUCON™-compatible 
digital audio workstations (DAWs), and use the EUCON Ethernet  protocol to provide fast, reliable data transmission. 
S6 and S4 are tightly integrated with a ll EUCON-compatible DAWs, providing access to many key commands, menu items, and 
controls. The Master Module and Automation Module each have editable Soft Keys that offer single-switch access to automation, editing, session management, and other commands. Both control surfaces provide substantial visual feedback to let you quickly identify tracks and their functi ons. Each strip inherits its color from the audi o application, and module controls light in dif ferent col-
ors for each function. Display Modules can display high-resolution,  multichannel colored meters, waveforms, auto mation data, an d 
functions. You can also use the Avid Control app for iOS and Android simultaneously for addi tional control and display.

gation, and other controls.
Display Module
(Optional for S6, S4 and S6 M10Plus Systems)
Each of its eight strips can disp lay metering, editable waveforms,  and other functions. Display Mod-
ules can also be configured as Master Meter Display M odules (MMM), or as Master Post Display 
Modules (MDM). 
Knob Module
(S6, Optional for S4 Systems)
Each of its eight strips has four knob sections with  displays. Knob Modules can also be configured as 
Attention Expa nd Zones. 
Process Module
(S6 Only)
Each of its eight strips has one knob section wi th a display, and multip le function switches. 
Fader Module
(S6 Only)
Each of its eight strips has a motorized fader, mete r, mute, solo, automation and other switches, an At-
tention key, and a display. One Fader Module can be configured as an Expand Fader zone. 
Master Joystick Module
(Optional for All Systems)
The optional Master Joystick Module provides two touch-sensitive joysticks,  a central pan display, 
dedicated panning mode switches, and other di splays and controls. 
Master Post Module
(Optional for All Systems)
The optional Master Post Module provides monito r and punch paddles like  a traditional PEC/DIR 
panel, along with other track  controls, a monitoring secti on, and a bank of Soft Keys. 
Channel Strip Module
(S4 Only)
The Channel Strip Module provides a lower fader sect ion, central function se lect section, and upper 
knob section. 



Chapter 1: Introduction to Avid | S6 and S4 3System Configurations
S6 and S4 systems offer differe nt capabilities , letting them be scaled for different installation sizes and requirements: 
S6 M40 Built around the Master Module Universal (previously called the M40), are suitable for larger configurations up to 64 or 
more fader strips, are expandable, support up to eight  connected workstations, and support Display Modules.
S6 M10 Plus Built around the Master Module M10 with M10 Plus License, are suitable for smaller configurations that desire Dis-
play Modules. S6 M10 Plus syst ems accommodate 8 to 24 fader st rips per frame and can control up to two connected workstations. 
S6 M10 Built around the Master Module M10, are suitable for smaller c onfigurations, accommodating 8 to 24 fader strips per frame, 
and supporting up to two connected workstations. M10-based systems do not support Display Modules.
S4 Built around the Master Module Universal,  are ideal for medium-sized configurations . S4 systems are available in 8–, 16–, and 
24–fader pre-assembled frames with up to th ree Channel Strip Modules, and support Di splay Modules. S4 sy stems can control up 
to two connecte d workstations. 
S6 systems are described by their processor (M10 or M40), the numbe r of fader strips in the system , and the number of knobs per  
strip. For example, an M40 24-9 D system includes 24 fader strips, 9 kn obs per strip, and Display Mo dules. S4 systems are de-
scribed by their number of fader strips (8, 16, or 24) and frame width (3, 4, or 5). For example, an S4 16-4 includes 16 fader strips 
in a 4-foot wide frame. 
S6 Surface Configurations
Modules can be arranged in many different ways. Figure 1 shows three arrangements for an S6 M10 16-5 configuration: Two Fader 
Modules (16 strips), two Process Modules (e ach providing 1 knob per strip), and two Knob Modules (each pr oviding 4 knobs per 
strip), for a total 5 knobs per strip. 
Figure 2 shows one possible arrangement for an S6 M40 32-9-D confi guration: Four Fader Modules (32 strips), four Process Modules  
(1 knob per strip), eight Knob Modules (8 knobs per strip), and four Display Modules (D), for a total 9 knobs per strip.Figure 1. Three 16-strip S6 M10 arrangements with Master Modules  to the left, in the center, and to the right of the Channel Mo dules

Installing S4/S6 Supporting Software
Your Avid Master Account also provides workstation softwa re for Windows and Mac, and S4/S6 documentation. XMON EUCON 
is also included in these installers. 
Whenever you update Master Module softwa re you must also update workstation so ftware on all connected workstations. 
After updating Master Module software, do the following: 
1Log in to your Avid Ma ster Account and download EUCON_WorkstationUnifiedInstall  software for your workstation (Mac or 
Windows), documentation, and other resources from the My Products and Subscriptions section. 
2If necessary, insert the USB driv e containing the downloaded EUCON_WorkstationUnifiedInstall into a USB port on your 
workstation. 
To install WSControl (workstation) software: 
3Double-click EUCON_WorkstationUnifiedInstall , then double-click the installer to launch it. 
4Follow the instructions on-screen (selec t each option you want to install):
• To only install S4/S6 Workstatio n software, click to select S4/ S6 Workstation .

Chapter 2: First Time Setup 12To uninstall items: 
1Launch the installer.
Items that are currently installed are select ed (checked) and indicated as Installed. 
2Do the following: 
• To uninstall specific component, make sure it is not selected  (no check mark).
• To uninstall all EUCON applications, select Uninstall all applications . 
• To uninstall all User Preferences, select Uninstall User Preferences  (your appsets will not be removed). 
3Click Continue  (Mac) or Next  (Windows). 
4Proceed to Connecting S4/S 6 to a Network .
Connecting S4/S6 to a Network
Each S4/S6 module and workstation requires a valid and unique IP address in the same range. This IP address can be created from  ei-
ther of the following:
• The DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server in the Master Module
• An external, third-party DHCP devi ce, such as a standalone router
Recommended Setup
Since S4/S6 requires substantial bandwidth, and the network timing between modules is critical, we recommend installing S4/S6 
and your workstation(s) on an isolated network/subn et using the Master Module’s internal DHCP server. 
To connect S6 with your workstation(s) using the Master Module’s internal DHCP server:
1Connect the Master Module from Ethernet port 2 on its back panel to the supplied Ethern et switch. (Either po rt can be used, but 
this guide uses port 2 in this example). 
2Connect all other modules and worksta tions to the same Ethernet switch. Do not connect any other eq uipment to this network . 
3Set your workstation network adapters to: Obtain IP addresses automatically by DHCP (default) .
If you must connect your workstation to a Wide Area Network (W AN) to access the Internet or a corporate network, we recom-
mend using a workstation with two Ethernet ports. Similarly, if your sy stem includes a Pro Tools | MTRX or MTRX Studio, use 
a dedicated network connec tion for DADman control. 
To connect your workstation to a WAN:
1Connect one port to the WAN, and connect the ot her port to the S6 Ethernet switch or to S4. 
2On the workstation that will connect to this  S4/S6 system, do either of the following:
•Mac: Click the WSControl icon in the Mac menu bar at the top-right of the screen.
•Windows: Right-click the WSControl icon in the system tray at the botto m-right of the screen. A Windows workstation name with any of the following characters will not be able to connect to S6: / \ [ ] " : ; |< > + = ,? * _ For 
more information, visit Microsoft Support Naming Conventions
Make sure you have followed all instructions in Software Activation  and installed the latest versi ons of S6 Workstation software 
(Mac and/or Windows) before connect ing S4/S6 to your workstations. 
Figure 6. Master Module back panel Ethernet ports 1 (l eft) and 2 (right) on an original S6 Master Module



Chapter 2: First Time Setup 133Select Network Setup .
4If your workstation has multiple ne tworks attached, make sure the Network Interface  selected is the one connected to your 
S4/S6.
5If you selected a new Network Interface , click Apply and Relaunch (Mac)  or Apply and Restart (Windows) to reboot the 
workstation and restart WSControl. 
The Master Module internal  DHCP Server uses the fo llowing default settings:
Advanced Setup 
To use a custom setup, you must have networking experience th at may require accessing a WAN usin g a router, or installing the 
entire S4/S6 network as part of a corporate network infrastructure.
If you will use a third-party DHCP device, Avid recommends the Cisco RV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router . 
Other routers have not reliably met the t iming requirements of the S6 modules. 
To connect S4/S6 to a DHCP router or server:
1Connect the Master Module from Ethe rnet port 1 on its back panel to  the supplied S4/S 6 network switch.
2Connect all other S4/S6 modu les to the same switch. 
3Connect the S4/S6 network switch to a LAN port on the third-party DHCP router. 
4Connect your workstation(s) to either the S4/S 6 network switch or the LAN ports on the router.
If your workstation has multiple ne tworks attached, make sure the Network Interface  selected is the one connected to your S6.Figure 7. Avid S6 WSControl Network Setup dialog

To connect S4/S6 to a corporate network, consult your IT depa rtment for guidance.



Chapter 2: First Time Setup 14Managing Network Connections
(Including Multiple, Selectable Network Connections)
The Master Module can be connected to one or two networks simultaneously and choose be tween them in order to utilize Ethernet 
KVM switches, and/or to save Titles, User Preferences, custom Soft Key Appsets, and other S4/S6 data to a WAN.
Network ports can be configured from the Settings > Surface, Local Options (Network Interface ) screen of the Master Module. 
These settings make it easier to maintain netw ork connections by letting you do the following: 
• Set the Master Module NIC to either static IP or DHCP. • Specify which static NIC will use the DHCP server.• Define the IP range the DHCP server will serve.• Select which NIC is the S4/S6 network if bo th ports on the Master Module are connected. 
Who Should Use These Settings
Do not use these settings if your system is working as expe cted, or if you do not have advanced networ k experience.
• If you have changed your network settings in any way it is likely that will not need to edit any of these settings. 
• If you get a network error, however, use these se ttings to select the desired configuration. 
To connect the Master Module to a different network in addition to the EUCON network: 
1Make sure you are using the internal DHCP server for the S4/S6 Network (Ethernet port 2 on the back of the Master Module). 
2Connect the other port (Ethernet port 1 on the back of the Master Module) to your other network. 
3Navigate to Settings > About , and choose  Shut Down . Wait until the Master Module has completely shut down. 
4Start the Master Module by pressing the switch on the top pa nel, behind the touchs creen (near the Talkback Thru port). 
The following message should appear on the Master Module when it restarts.
If it does not, make sure port  1 has a valid network connection and IP addr ess, and restart the Ma ster Module again. 
5Tap to dismiss the message, then go to Settings > Surface  and tap the Local Options (gear) icon  at the lower right of the screen. The following instructions are recommended primarily for single operator systems and basic S6 /network configur ations. There are  
many other options to configur e systems without using the inte rnal DHCP server. For more in formation and advanc ed configura-
tion instructions, see the document EUCON Networking Guidelines.pdf , available from the S4/S6 Support article on our Knowl-
edge Base. This information is updated frequently as more supported workflows are added so check back regularly. 
http://avid.force.com/pkb/ar ticles/faq/Avid -S6-Support  
These settings are for advanced us ers with prior networking experience only. In correct settings could render your system inoper -
able. Consult your IT department for guidance if you are not sure of  any of the re quired settings.

Chapter 2: First Time Setup 16Choices include the following: 
•Unknown (leave unchanged) Indicates a port that could not be  determined at startup, such as if that port was not connected. 
•Custom Static IP (leave unchanged) Indicates a port that was set to an IP outside the S4/S6 expected range through the OS. 
This method is no longer recommended, and should only be used  if for whatever reasons you need to continue using the pre-
viously available (pre-v3.5) method of editing the dhcpsvr.ini  file manually. 
• IP Address Assigned by External DHCP Server
• Range of supported IP addresses ( 192.168.2.0  – 192.168.10.3 ), with a fixed subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. 
2If desired, click to Enable DHCP Server on Interface 1  (or 2). 
This setting is only available when you ha ve set a static IP from the fixed range. It is unavailable if the NIC is set to DHCP  or 
the Custom/Unknown  setting. 
3Once the settings are changed, the NICs are updated and then the DHCP server script s updated. The Database  file will be de-
leted and the system will shut down automatically. 
4Wait for the Master Module to completely shut down, and then power cycle the entire S6 system. 
Desk ID 
It is allowed, though not recommended, to change the Desk ID at the same time as changing othe r Network Interface settings. If 
the Desk ID or selected interface is change d, the system will automatically  shut down (the DHCP server/NIC IP change takes pre-
cedence). It is likely that you will have to reselect the interface once the system starts up again and after you power cycle a ll mod-
ules. 
To revert to a single (EUCON) network: 
1Go to Settings > Surface , click the Network Interface select or, and choose First Available. 
This selects which NIC is the S4/S6 network if both ports on the Master Module are connected. 
2Remove the network cable from Master Module port 1, then restart S4/S6. All modules and workstations must  be power cycled after making changes to the NI C or DHCP settings. Failure to power cycle all 
modules and workstations can result in some or all modules on the wrong network. 
Network Interface configured for just S6 (EUCON) network
If you remove the cable wi thout restarting, the next time the system is restarted a warning me ssage is displayed. Follow the 
on-screen instructions to re set the Network Interface to First Available and restart.

Configuring Multiple Systems on One Network
Multiple S4/S6 systems can operate on one network, but each system  and the workstation that controls it must be able to identif y each 
other. The Desk ID  Surface option lets you assign a unique number for this S4/S6 surface. Yo u then assign that same number to the 
workstation that will control that S4/S6. 
If your installation has just one S4/S6 system on a network, leave the Desk ID  set to its default value of 1. 
To set a unique Desk ID:
1Touch the Local Options icon at the bottom-right of the Surface page. Th e Surface options open; Desk ID  is the only entry.
2Drag the slider to set the desired numbe r, which displays to the right of it. 
A message box (outlined in yellow) appears at  the top of the touchscreen to inform you that the Master Module must restart to 
enact this change. Touching Cancel  avoids restarting and leaves Desk ID  with its previous setting. 
When the Master Module reboots, the previous arra ngement is cleared and you must create a new one.
3On the workstation(s) that will connect to  this S4/S6 system, make sure you have in stalled Workstation software, then do the fo l-
lowing:
•Mac: Click the WSControl icon in the Mac menu bar at the top-right of the screen.
– or –
•Windows: Right-click the WSControl icon in the system tray at the botto m-right of the screen. 
•Select  Network Setup .Figure 17. Finished Surface Arrangement (S6 shown at left, S4 shown at right
Figure 18. Local Options icon (le ft) and Desk ID slider (right)



Chapter 2: First Time Setup 234In the WSControl Network Setup dialog, set the Desk ID  to the same number as in step 1. 
5If your workstation has multiple ne tworks attached, make sure the Network Interface  selected is the one connected to your 
S4/S6.
6If you only changed the Desk ID, click Apply  to restart WSControl. 
7If you changed the Network Interface, click Apply and Relaunch (Mac)  or Apply and Restart (Windows) to reboot the work-
station and restart WSControl.
Connecting S4/S6 to Workstations
In order to control an audio application with S4/S6, you must fi rst install Mac or Windows Workst ation software on the desired 
computer. Then you connect that workstation to S4/S6 using the Settings  > Workstations  page. 
Multiple workstations can be connected to S4/S6 at once, but only one is attentioned  (or focused) at a time. The attentioned work-
station has exclusive focus of the S4/S6 su rface. A workstation can be selected but no t attentioned so you can derive informati on 
about the workstation, its applic ations, and EUCON version. Custom  names can be assigned to co nnected workstations. When mul-
tiple workstations are conne cted, you can choose to Show Workstation Number  on S4/S6 displays (the number corresponds to 
the order in which Workstations appear in the Connected list of Settings > Workstation ). 
To connect a workstation to S4/S6:
1Navigate to the Workstations  page by doing either of the following:
• On the Master Module, press Settings  and then touch Workstations  at the top of the Settings  screen.
• Or press Shift  + WS (hold down Shift  and press WS).
The Workstations screen appears, wi th the Network column on the left a nd the Connected column on the right. 
2Drag a workstation from the Network  list over to a slot in the Connected  list.
• The workstation na me appears in the Connected slot, flashes as it conn ects, and then appears so lid when it connects. 
•T h e  focused  application (top-most application on that workstation) is listed on the lower right. 
• If a previous workstation was connecte d to that slot, it  is disconnected. 
• The workstation is selected a nd attentioned, which is i ndicated by an orange (upper half) a nd blue (lower half) rectangular ou tline.
In Figure 21, the workstation in the Connected  list is selected and atte ntioned, and Pro Tools is th e focused application. (Note 
that EUCON must be enabled within Pro Tool s before it can conne ct, as explained in Enabling EUCON Connectivity ).Figure 19. Setting the Desk ID in the WSControl Network Setup dialog

Chapter 4: Home Screen 32The Attention Track Editor
In the Attention Track Editor, you select a function from the Function Scroller to display and edit in the Function Editor usin g the 
Attention Track Knobs. Each function has its own co lor so their parameters are easy to distinguish. 
Function Colors
S4/S6 displays different function s in unique colors, shown in the table, below. These colors are displayed in the Attention Tra ck 
Editor, Function Scroller, an d on knobs in channel strips. 
When more than one plug-in of the same type or category is inserted on a single track, the Ma ster Module knobs light in slightl y 
different colors to differentiate plug-in c ontrols. For example, multiple EQ plug-ins are shown in different shades of magenta.  Figure 31. Attention Track Editor with Function Scroller

Chapter 4: Home Screen 33Function Scroller
The Function Scroller shows the Attention Track functions. 
While the selected function’s para meters take precedence, the Function Editor ca n display parameters from additional functions,  
depending on the number of parameters and a preference setting. You can al so set default function views and knob focus for the 
Home screen (see Home Screen Options ). 
You can select one functi on at a time to edit in the Function Editor. 
To select a function from the Function Scroller to edit in the Function Editor:
Touch a function in the Function Scroller.
The selected function has an orange outline.
Function Editor
The Function Editor can display up to eight co lumns of eight parameters each. The four parameters in the top or bottom half of each 
column can be assigned to the left  or right Attention Track Knobs. Figure 32. Function Scroller with Pan selected
Figure 33. Function Editor



Chapter 4: Home Screen 34Assigning New Parameters to the Attention Track Knobs
The left and right Attention Trac k Knobs can each control four para meters from any single function. 
To assign a new bank of four parameters to the Attention Track Knobs:
1Touch a function in the Function Scroller. 
2Touch a group of four parameters in th e Function Editor. Two brackets flash sl owly around the selected parameters.
3Before the brackets stop flashing, touch or turn any Attention Tr ack Knob. The four selected parameters are assigned to that 
side’s Attention Track Knobs, and the Function Editor provides the following visual feedback:
• The parameter name, knob stat e, and value appear beside each Attention Track Knob.
• A left bracket (green in Figure 33) indi cates the parameters to its right are assi gned to the left At tention Track Knobs. 
• A right bracket (purple in Figure 33) indicates the parameters to its left are assigned to th e right Attention Track Knobs. 
Using Page Switches to Navigate Attention Track Knobs
When the Master Module Shift  switch is held down, you can use the four switche s at the bottom left and right of the touchscreen 
to page functions and focus the touchscreen knobs on different pa rameters. A focused knob group ca n page even if the knobs are 
locked. When in Page mode, the switch LEDs light purple. 
When in Page mode: 
• The Home  and Swap  switches assign the Left knobs to thei r previous or next pages, respectively. 
• The Back  ( )and Config  switches assign Right knobs to their previous or next pa ges, resp ectively. 
• If the Left and Right knobs are from th e same function, each set of Page sw itches operates on both knob groups.
Using the Attention Track Knobs
Each Attention Track Knob section provides In and Sel switches ( 1 in Figure 35 ) and a dual-function knob with automation indi-
cator LEDs ( 2 in Figure 35 ). The knob lights when active, and in cert ain contexts can also be pushed. 
In Toggles a parameter in and out, or betw een two values (as available in the curr ent application); it lights when active. 
Sel Toggles the knob function or a secondary parameter va lue (such as Q and Frequency for an EQ plug-in). You can assign different function parameters to the left and right Attent ion Track Knobs (see Locking the Knobs ).

Chapter 4: Home Screen 35Function Editor Knob Types
Four virtual knob types are used to represent different kinds of parameters in the Function Edit or. Figure 36 shows an EQ plug-i n 
that demonstrates each type. 
1 – Typically represents Q but can be used for other parameters  that pertain to width . This knob type has two white marks at each 
end that move symmetrically as Q changes.
2 – Typically represents parametric filter gain but can be used for other parameters that boost  and cut level from a center position. 
This knob type has an outer ring that moves right or left from the top-center as the parameter boosts or cuts; its white mark s hows 
the level of boost or cut.
3 – This knob type does not have an outer ring. The white mark denotes position within a range of values  not level.
4 – This knob type has an outer ring, which emphasizes that the white mark denotes level not position. 
Locking the Knobs
When a new function is selected in the Fu nction Scroller, its first para meter bank is assigned to th e Attention Track Knobs. Yo u 
can prevent this by locking the Attention Track Knobs (left, right, or both) to their curre nt parameters (see Figure 37). 
Locked knobs are maintained per track. Attentioning different tr acks and returning to a track with  locked knobs restores the lo cked 
assignments.Figure 36. Knob types used in the Function Editor

Open Windows on Workstation When Knobs Assigned
The Home screen Lo cal Options setting Open Windows on Workstation When Knobs Assigned  option lets you restrict the open-
ing of plug-in windows to actions  taken on a specific module. 
• Attentioning a track opens the plug-in window that corresponds to the Primary or Backup Function for that module. 
• Manually or automatically assigning a plug- in or its parameters to controls on th e selected module (only) opens the corre-
sponding plug-in window. 
To optimize plug-in window display for S6: 
1Go to Settings > User , and make sure Open Windows on Workstation When Editing Mode  is enabled. 
• When enabled, plug-in windows open when selecting a plug-i n function from a strip (Process Module), or from the module 
specified in the Open Plug-Ins on Workstation When Knobs Assigned  selector. 
• When disabled, plug-in windows do not open in response to any S6 actions. 
2Navigate to the Home screen, then open the Local Options page (tap the gear icon).

Chapter 4: Home Screen 41Expand Knob and Expand Fader Function Settings
The Home screen Local Options settings for Expand Knob Function and Backup Function Selected on Attention Change  let you 
configure functions to disp lay on Attention Expand Knob Zones wh en a track is attentioned. Two pairs of selectors set primary a nd 
backup functions for each of up to two Knob Module s. A similar pair of se lectors is available for Expand Fader Function and 
Backup Function Selected on Attention Change (Expand Fader Zones are available on S6 only). 
The D isplay Knobs From Most Recently Clicked DAW Area setting lets you specify where y ou want clicked DAW controls to 
appear (such as only on the Master Module, on an Expa nd Knob Module, or on both the Master and Expand Fader).
Expand Modules use the Primary and Backup Functions when clicked DAW controls do not have a corresponding knob type (such 
as clicking on Track Name or in the timeli ne). In addition to extending the usefulness of the Primary and Backup Function setti ngs, 
this also prevents Attention Expand Zones from goi ng blank in certain attention-via-click scenarios.

Home screen is not automatically  displayed when a track is atte ntioned in the Tracks screen. 
Auto Select Joystick Strips when Storing Layouts
The Tracks Local Option setting Auto Select Joystick Strips when Storing Layouts  determines the initial state of the joystick 
blocks when storing Layouts. The default setting is off. 
This setting only affects the initia l state of the Joystick strip blocks. 
When not enabled Joy 1 and Joy 2 blocks are unlit (no green highlight) when storing a Layout , meaning their assignments will not 
be stored and recalled with th e current Layout. You can override  this default state by tapping Joy 1 or Joy 2 so that they ligh t green. 
When enabled Joy 1 and Joy 2 blocks are automaticall y lit (green highlight) when  storing a Layout, meanin g their assignments will 
be stored and recalled with the current Layout. You can override this state by tapping so they become unlit. 
Store Hidden Virtual Strips in Layouts
This setting lets you show or hide “virtual” stri ps in Layouts that exceed the current setting for Number of Strips in Layout , and 
for Number of Post Strips in Post Layout . 
For example, if the current Number of Strips Per Layout  setting is 24, and you load a Title (Layouts) file that  was saved with 64 
strips per Layout, the first 24 strips will be ava ilable but the remaining 48 will not. By enabling Store Hidden Virtual Strips in Lay-
outs, the additional 48 virtual strips will be retained in the Title (though not visible). When this setting is not enabled, additi onal 
strips will not be saved. 
Double Tap Assign to Copy Tracks from Banking Mode into Current Layout
When selected, double-tapping the Assign bu tton (Tracks screen) places all currently ba nked tracks onto blocks in the lower str ip 
scroller to quickly update or create  a layout. For more information, see  Chapter 23, “Layouts”
Number of Strips in Layout
You can specify the number of strips available for track assignm ent in Layouts from the Tracks Local Options screen. Using the 
Number of Strips in Layout  setting, Layouts can include more trac ks than available physical strips. 
When a Layout that includes vi rtual strips is reca lled, all surface banking controls are available to bank and nudge. If the La yout 
was saved on a system with more strips than the curre nt system, increase the Number of Strips in Layout  setting to access the ad-
ditional Layout members. 


Chapter 5: Tracks Screen 49To configure virtual strips: 
1Navigate the touchscreen to the Tracks scre en, and tap the Local Options (gear) icon. 
2In the Tracks Local Options screen, adjust the Number of Strips in Layout  slider to the desired valu e between 8 and 256 strips.

Number of Layout Swap Layers
Choose 2, 3, or 4 layers. Default is 1 (no Swap layers). 
Show Available Swap Track Names on Display Module
When enabled, Display Modules show the name s of all tracks assigned to other Swap la yers below the currently active track (list ed 
on top). Note that enabling this option can impact perfor mance (such as how quickly Display Modules follow banking). 
Insert/Delete Assign Modes Affect All Swap Layers
When enabled, inserting or de leting a track from a Swap layer inserts or  deletes that slot in all Swap layers. 
Post Layouts
The settings in this section let you op timize Master Post  Display Modules. 
Number of Post Strips in Post Layout 
You can specify the number of Ma ster Post Module strips available for assignment in Post La youts from the Tracks Local Options 
screen. Using the Number of Post Strips in Layout  setting, Post Layout s can include more tracks than  available Master Post Mod-
ule strips. 
When a Post Layout that includes virtual st rips is recalled to a Master Post Module , banking and nudging controls are available  to 
bring different member tracks to the strips on the Master Post Module. 
Layout
The Layout  selector sets whether MPMs show Large Meters, or Large Meters and Automation. 
Number of Post Rows
You can specify how many tracks are displayed on MDMs using the Number of Post Rows  slider. Default MDM views are 10 
tracks in width, matching the Master Post Module, and you can ch oose to display up to 4 rows of  10 meters. One additional, larg er 
view is available that provide s two rows of five tracks.
Mirror Post Strips on Multiple Post Modules
When enabled on systems with more than one Master Post Module, all Mast er Post Modules are linked to act as a single, mirrored 
unit. Track assignments are mirrored (identical) on all Master Post  Modules. In the St rip scroller (Layouts) , a single set of M aster 
Post Module strips is displayed. 
When disabled, each Master Post  Module has their own set of tracks. In the Strip scroller (Layouts), unique Master Post Module 
strips are displayed for each module. Diffe rent tracks can be assign ed, recalled, and controlled to or from each module. 
Auto Assign PEC Meters from Post Tracks Assign
This setting, located in the Tracks > Local Options  (gear icon) can simplify assignment of  tracks for MDMs. When enabled, as-
signing a track to a Post Layout automatically  assigns it as the PEC track on the MDM. When not enabled, assign tracks to PEC 
and DIR manually. 


Chapter 5: Tracks Screen 50DIR Meters in Red
The two meter sources are distinguis hed by different colored meters on the MDM, selectable to be either blue and green (the de-
fault), or red and green.This setting, located in the Display  section of the Settings > User  page, controls the colors that indicate 
PEC and DIR meters on MDMs. By default, DIR meters are blue a nd PEC are green. When this option is enabled, DIR meters will 
be red (PEC are always green). 
Meter Layouts
The controls in the Meter Layouts  section of the Tracks > Local Options  screen lets you configure the layout of MMM displays. 
Both of these settings ar e stored per Meter Layout.

You can attention different workstations by ta pping to select them in the Connected li st of the Workstations screen, using the Mas-
ter Module Soft Keys (see Workstations, Layouts, and Tracks Soft Keys ), or by attentioning tracks (see Focus Workstation 
of Most Recently Selected Track ). 
Layouts and other S4/S6 data can be saved and auto-loaded (see Autoload from T itles and Sessions ). 
Switching KVM Source Independent of Workstation Focus
By default, changing focus to a different wo rkstation also switches the KVM (if any, see KVM Switch ). You can instead switch 
only the KVM without changing workstation focus. 
To switch the KVM without changing workstation focus: 
1Navigate to either the Settings > Workstation  screen, or press the Master Module WS switch to list available workstations on 
the Master Module Soft Keys. 
2On the Master Module hold the Shift  switch (in the Navigation switch sectio n) then do either of the following: 
• Tap to select a workstation on the Workstation screen. • Press the Soft Key for a different workstation. 
The attached KVM switches to the select ed workstation but does not focus that workstation. On-screen, a KVM icon appears 
next to the current KVM source. Figure 47. Settings screen with Workstations page selected

Chapter 8: Soft Keys 60Chapter 8: Soft Keys
The Master Module, Automation Mo dule, and Master Post Module Soft Keys  are pre-configured to provide convenient access to 
many of the most used features and commands in your DAW. Yo u can also create your own Soft  Keys assignments to optimize 
your workflows, including specific custom izable keys on Fade r Modules and CSMs. (Not all DAW  manufacturers supply Soft 
Keys for S4/S6.) 
Overview of Soft Keys
Soft Keys are organized into pages a rranged on the different So ft Key banks on the Master  and Automation Modules. 
• Two banks of Soft Keys, each with 15 Soft Keys surrounding it s own display, are provided on both the Master and Automation 
Modules. 
• The Master Post Module provides a single bank of 15 Soft Keys. • On Fader Modules, most switches surroundi ng the strip display can be customized. 
Each page can provide keys to execute on e or more DAW commands, page jumps to ot her Soft Key pages, S6 surface commands, 
and alpha-numeric keys and co mmands. The Automation Module Wheel switches, Locate switches, Numeric Keypad, and Trans-
port switches are also editable Soft Keys, as are the switch es in the Monitoring section on the Master Post Module. 
Default Soft Key assignments (known as an Appset, or Application Set) are provided for Pro Tools, DADMan (for 
Pro Tools | MTRX and MTRX Studio), Logic Pro, Nuendo, Cubase, Py ramix, and other applications (for other DAWs, contact the 
manufacturer). To get started utilizing the fa ctory-assigned Soft Ke ys for Pro Tools, see 
Using Soft Keys . 
Soft Keys can be customized to  add or rearrange commands, and custom assignme nts can be exported and imported. S6 provides 
a Soft Key Editor in the Settings screen for creating and managing Soft Keys. You can  add, delete, re name, color, save and load  
Soft Keys. Multiple layers of assignments are available via modifier keys. Full-c olor icons can be assign ed to both the active and 
inactive states, and background colors and names can be changed. 
Soft Key assignments can includ e multiple EUCON commands in addition to comb inations of Key, Page, and Surface commands. 
You can also configure Soft Keys to apply to multiple DAWs.
To learn how to create and edit Soft Keys, see Soft Keys Editor . 
About Appsets and Software Updates
S6 software uses a default Appset installed at the factory. If you have customized any Soft Key assignments, S6 creates and mai n-
tains those in a custom Appset and uses th at set instead of the factory default set. Instal ling new S6 Master Module software w ill 
not install the default Appsets if  you have customized the Appset from a previous  version in any way. To access the new factory  
Appset provided in the most rece nt Master Module software, firs t save your custom Appset (see Importing and Exporting Soft 
Key Appsets ). After updating the system press Factory  at the bottom of the Soft Key Editor  (any custom Soft Keys will be lost 
and will need to be reassigned). 
Location of AppSet Files on the Master Module
If you ever need to locate an appset file you can find them at the following location on the Master Module C: drive: 
C:\ProgramData\A vid\S6\AppSets\Check out the Avid Pro Tools | S6 Workflows  on YouTube for in-depth explorations of  how to use S6, including Layouts, Spill 
Zones, Expand Zones, and more. Check back frequently for updates to this ongoing series. 
The available Soft Keys on your system may differ from those shown in this document, depending on whic h version of S6 software 
is installed, whether an S6 appset is  available for your DAW, and whether you have customized  your Soft Keys. 


Chapter 8: Soft Keys 61Importing and Exporting Soft Key Appsets
The Soft Keys screen ( Settings  > Soft Keys ) provides Export  and Import  buttons to store and load Appset files. 
•U s e  Export to save custom Soft Ke y assignments to disk for archiving and transfer.
•U s e  Import  to recall saved Appsets for a specific project or when you move to a different system. You can also load Appsets 
from earlier versions of the current DAW. 
•U s e  Factory  to replace the currently loaded Soft  Key assignments with th e default assignments for your DAW. (If you have 
customized any Soft Keys, be sure to save y our assignments before resetting to Factory.) 
Location of Custom Appsets
The ability to import and export Appsets lets you backup and transfer Soft Key assignments. 
S4/S6 Appset files are stored in the follow ing default location on the Master Module:
C:\ProgramData\Avid\S6\Appsets
If the ProgramData folder is hidden, do the following to show it:
1Navigate the touchscreen to the Settings > About  page and press Logout .

Chapter 8: Soft Keys 62Using Soft Keys
Take a few minutes to explore the default So ft Key assignments for Pro Tools to familia rize yourself with wh at is available, ho w 
the pages and keys are organized, and how to  navigate among them. The following secti ons include examples that highlight some 
of the features provided in the default Pro Tools appset. 
Navigating Soft Keys
To begin, look at the default first pa ge on the pair of Master Module Soft Key banks. These banks are labeled Automation 1 and 
Session Management 1 . Most banks are color coded to make it easier to r ecognize their function. For example, session manage-
ment pages have a blue banner, while automation pages are red, editing pages are green, and so on. 
Navigation keys are provided along the bottom of each bank. 
Pressing the Menu  switch jumps to the Page Menu keys, which list numerous other available pa ges. Similarly, pressing Playlists  
or Show/Hide  jumps to those corresponding pages. 
Pressing Home  (when available) jumps back to  the first page in that bank. 
Quick View of Layer 2
Hold down the Ctrl switch on any Fader Module to  access alternate functions (layer  2) on some Soft Key pages. If you have customized your Soft Keys, use the Export command in the Soft Key edito r to ensure your custom  appset is exported a nd 
saved. Then restore the Factory appset to see the new assignments for Pro Tools. To restore your custom appset, use the Import 
command to load them.
Navigation switches along the bottom of the left Soft Ke y bank on the Master Module (default Pro Tools appset)
The default appset provided for Pro Tools is  updated and improved with each software re lease, so it is possible that not all of  the

DAWs from a single Soft Key. Feedback (LED i ndication of function state) and a Delay (“ wait”) time can be specified as needed. 
To configure a multi-DAW Soft Key command: 
1Make sure all desired work stations are connected in Settings > Workstation . 
2Go to Settings > Soft Keys , and select an existing Soft Key command or create a new one. Mu lti-DAW Soft Keys can include 
EUCON, Key, and Surface commands. When a command is as signed to a Soft Key, or its command block (such as EUCON ) 
is selected in the Soft Key Editor, the Options  menu appears at the bottom of the Soft Keys page. 
3Press Options  to display the Command Options  window. Options command in the Soft Key Editor

Default Multi-DAW Commands
The default Pro Tools Appset includes many pre-configured multi-DAW commands for some  of the most frequently requested au-
tomation tasks. These include Write to All, Preview, Punch, Auto -Match, and Save. Even if you do not expect to need these speci fic 
commands, you can look at them in the Soft Key Editor to  see examples of how multi-DAW commands are defined. 
To access these new Soft Keys: 
1Make sure you have impo rted the default (factory) Appset for Pro Tools. 
2On the Automation Module > right Soft Keys bank > Home  page, press the Soft Key for User Pages , then press User 3 . 
The commands on the User 3 page are all pre-configured to apply to All workstations. To distingu ish them from other, single-DAW  
commands an asterisk (*) has been added at the end of their command names. 
Beginning in version 20.5, exec ution of multi-DAW commands was standardized to co rrectly interpret an d indicate command 
state. The following table lists examples of multi-DAW commands availabl e in Pro Tools (note that mu lti-DAW can be applied to 
any Soft Key that is a multi-state switch): Command block indicating Multi, Delay, and Feedback status

Chapter 8: Soft Keys 77Identifying Multi-DAW Sync Soft Keys in the Soft Key Editor
In the Soft Key Editor, EUCON commands that support  multi-DAW sync are indi cated with yellow text. 
Soft Key LED Indication of Multi-DAW Parameter States
Multi-DAW Soft Keys now indicate status by show ing three unique states  for the Soft Key LED. 
MultiDAW Soft Key Feedback From Focused DAW
This setting optimizes LED indication and focused DAW feedback , and applies to all multi-DAW Soft Keys from any DAW. If you 
enable the MultiDAW Soft Key Feedba ck From Focused DAW Only  option for a Soft Key, the multi-DAW LEDs will not dim 
(they will only show you the stat e of the focused DAW). In addition, if the cu rrently focused DAW is not set as one of the 
multi-DAW Soft Key targets, the LED will be off no ma tter the state of any DAWs affected by the Soft Key.
Modifier Locks
Soft Keys can be created in modifier-driven layers for existing Soft Keys. 
The Modifier Locks  section lets you “lock” modi fier keys on (pressed) to create Soft Ke ys that become available while a modifier 
key is pressed. This lets you create new Soft  Keys in the same position as an existi ng Soft Key but which only becomes availabl e 
when holding down the associated modifier switch on the Fader Module. 
Once defined, you can toggle the Soft Ke y view between modifier “layers” by hold ing down the associated modifier key(s). Multi-DAW Sync-compatible commands in the Soft Key Editor

set of Monitoring switches, all of which ca n be customized in the Soft Key Editor. 
Soft Keys on Fader Modules and CSMs
See Channel Strip Keys .


Chapter 9: Channel Strip Keys 80Chapter 9: Channel Strip Keys
Using the Soft Key Editor you ca n customize the assignments for channel keys  (Fader Module switches surrounding the track 
OLED (display) such as Select , Swap , M S, Menu , and L G, as well as the F (A)  and M (T)  switches). 
Custom channel keys let you put  commands you use most often directly onto Fader Module strips. Both the Attention and Menu  
switches are available as modifiers for up to three “layers” per hardware switch (one  default layer, one layer accessible while  the 
strip Attention switch is held  down, and anot her while strip Menu  is held down). 
Custom assignments can be the same on all tracks or be unique per track ty pe, and you can save and load different assignments f or 
different workflows. For example, on a post production project y ou might want single-key access to Spill functions, but for a b and 
or other music tracking session it would be more useful to have Record Enable, Inpu t Monitoring, and DSP Mode on each strip. 
Custom channel keys also provide access to Pro Tools Plug-in Copy and Paste , improved Customizing Auto mation Mode Se-
lection and Cycling  options and Auto Take Over  mode. 
About New Available Commands
(Pro Tools 2022.9 or Higher)
In addition to customizable ch annel keys, other new commands are also availabl e with S4/S6 2022.12 including Pro Tools Plug-In 
Copy and Paste, Surface Command to Add (or Remove) Track to Layout , Display Track Type , and more. 
Using Channel Keys
To access and apply channel keys: 
On the Fader Module for the desired track, press the key to perform its a ssigned primary function. 
To access additional layers hold down  either modifier lock to access the Attention  or Menu  layer assignments. Original Fader Modules labeled the two automation keys M and F. Current Fader Modules  label these keys T (for Trim) and A 
(for Automation). Functionality is the same on both generations of Fader Modules. In this and other guides, these switches are re-
ferred to as M (T) and F (A).

Chapter 10: Using the S4 Channel Strip Module 86Chapter 10: Using the S4 Channel Strip Module
Channel Strip Modules (CSMs) provide the fader strips for S4 sy stems (only). Each CSM provides ei ght fader strips with a lower 
fader section and upper knob section, an d central function select section. 
CSMs provide the same functionality on S4 as Fader, Process, and Knob Module s on S6. The primary differences are: 
• The CSM provides a single set of Function Select switches fo r the eight fader strips , unlike the S6 Process Module which pro-
vides Function switches fo r each fader strip. Function Select switches include EQ, Dyn, Exp, and more. 
• The CSM fader Focus  switch determines the fader strip to wh ich the Function Sele ct switches apply. Focus  is only available 
on the S4 CSM, not on S6 Fader Modules. 
Throughout this guide, references  to switches on S6 Fader, Process, and Knob mo dules also apply to the equivalent sw itches on 
CSMs. Channel Strip Module
Knob section
Fader sectionFunction Select


Chapter 10: Using the S4 Channel Strip Module 87Function Switches
The Function switches select the function displayed on the Knobs. They operate similarly to the Func tion switches on S6 Process  
Modules, except that on the CS M they apply to the currently Focused  strip. 
Expand
Expand  mode maps parameters beyond the curre nt strip, expanding (or “spilling”) EQ, dynamics, or other functions across mul-
tiple controls on the upper Knob section, or to th e lower Fader section, on the same CSM as the track. Attention Expand mode uses 
up to two optional Knob Modules as Attention E xpand zones. 
For complete instructions for using stri p Expand and Attention Expand Zones, see Expand . 
Clear (Reset to Default)
You can quickly reset faders, individual para meters, functions, Ex pand Fader maps, or entire tracks  to their default values usi ng the 
Clear  switch, located at left of the CSM Fu nction select section, and on the top of each strip on the S6 Process Module. 
To clear: 
1Press Clear  on the desired strip. Its LED flashes red, and switches  for all functions available to be reset are lit. 
2While Clear  is engaged (flashing) do any of the following: 
• To reset a fader unity (0 dB on the strip), press F in the CSM Fader section, or on the S6 Fader Module, or touch the fader. 
• To reset an individual para meter, press its knob top.
• To reset a function, press the desired f unction switch in that strip (such as EQ, Dyn, or Pan). Not all functions support Clear. 
• To reset an entire strip, press the strip Select  switch (in the CSM Fader section, or on the S6 Fader Module). 
The parameter or function resets and the Clear  switch stops flashi ng and remains unlit. 
Func (Enable All Plug-In Automation)
Pressing the Func  switch on a CSM (or S6 Process Module) enables automation  for all controls in that strip’s currently focused EQ, 
Dyn, or Insert function. 
To protect automation data, pressing the Func  switch only enables (it does not toggle automation off). 
Function Select Switches
The function select switches let you assign  different functions to the Knob Module (S6) or upper knob section of the CSM (S4). One 
function can be selected at a time, and its function select switch lights. 
Ins, Dyn, EQ, and User switches each have a corresponding In switch.On the S6 Process Module, In switches are next to their 
function select switches. On the S4 CSM, In switches are below their function select switches.

Chapter 10: Using the S4 Channel Strip Module 93Channel Keys and Automation
Using the Soft Key Editor you can customize the assignments for channel keys  (CSM switches surrounding the track OLED (dis-
play) such as Select , Swap , M S, Menu , and L G, as well as the F (A)  and M (T)  switches). 
Custom channel keys let you put commands you use most of ten directly onto CSM strips. Both the Attention and Menu  switches 
are available as modifiers for up to three “layers” per hardware switch  (one default layer, one la yer accessible while the stri p At-
tention switch is held do wn, and another while strip Menu  is held down). You can also cust omize Automation mode cycling, en-
gage Auto Take Over , and more.

Zones, Expand Zones, a nd more. Most of these videos ar e also relevant to S4, so chec k back frequently for updates. 
Nudging and Banking
You can nudge and bank tracks assigned to the surface using switches on the Master M odule, or from any Fader Module or CSM. 
The switches described in this section le t you nudge and bank tracks in standard Ba nking mode, Layouts mode, and within spill 
zones. You can also lock strips to make them unaffected  by banking (see Locking Strips ). 
Nuding and Banking Using the Master Module
Switches in the Navigation sect ion of the Master Module let you nudge and bank  tracks in banking mode, spill zones and Layouts.  References to switches and displays on S6 F ader, Process, and Knob Modules also appl y to S4 CSMs unless noted otherwise. 
For additional ways to arrange tracks on the surface, see Chapter 23, “Layouts.”

Chapter 11: Common Tasks 103All Folder Soft Keys support Do  to All and Do to Selected. 
Parent, Sibling, and Child Folders
S4 and S6 Soft Ke ys use the terms Parent , Child , and Sibling  in Folder commands to provide maximum flexibility when opening 
and closing Folder Trac ks from the surface. 
Parent Folder Tracks are the top-most Folder Track in a hierarchy of nested  Folder Tracks. In the following diagram Folder Track 
A is a Parent Folder Track to Folder Track B. 
The Open/Close Folder  commands open/close the currently attentioned Folder Track. For exampl e, if Folder Track A is atten-
tioned, the Open/Close Folder  commands open/close Folder Track A. If B is attentioned, they open/c lose Folder Track B. 
Child Folder Tracks are nested within a Parent Folder Tracks. Pro Tools Folder  Tracks can be nested up to nine layers. In the fol-
lowing diagram Folder Track B is nested with in A, C is nested within B, and D is nest ed within C, meaning B is a child of A, C is 
a child of B, and D is a child of C.
Open/Close Child Folders  opens/closes all folders contained within the currently attentioned trac k. In the example diagram above, 
if Folder Track B is attentioned the Open/Close Child Folders  commands open/close Folder  Tracks C and D. (The Open/Close 
Sibling Folders  commands do nothing since in this example th ere is only one Folder Track per layer.)
Sibling Folder Tracks are nested Folder Tracks that are at the same layer with in their parent folder. In the following diagram Folder 
Track A contains Folder Tracks B, C, and D, making Folder Tracks B, C, D sibling  Folder Tracks. 
For example, if Folder Track A is attentioned you can use the Open/Close Child Folders  commands to open/close Folder Tracks 
B, C, and D. If Folder Track B,  C, or D are attentioned, use the Open/Close Sibling Folders  commands to open/close Folder Tracks 
B, C and D. Soft Keys for Meter Layouts

• To exit without changing th e current assignment, press any other Function switch. 
• To select a different output, press the knob showing th e current assignment. The to p two knobs show available interface  and 
bus outputs. Rotate the correspondi ng knob until the desired output is displayed, then press the In switch for that knob. This 
assigns the selected output as the onl y output (removes any other assignments).
• To assign an additional output to the trac k, rotate the corresponding knob until the desired output is displayed and press the  
Sel switch on the corresponding knob. This results in multiple output assignments (as indicated by the yellow Sel LED light-
ing, and on-screen in Pro Tools with a “+ ” in the Output assignment selector). 
• To return to the previous  page of choices, press Back . 
Navigating Through Multiple Output Assignments
When there are multiple outputs assigned to a track, you can quickly navigate th rough assignments by pressing the corresponding  
knob top. For example, if multiple bus out puts are assigned to a track you can press the bus knob to cycle through each current ly 
assigned output. 



Chapter 11: Common Tasks 112Adjusting Track Parameters
Many track parameters can be adjusted directly from the surface, such as track volume and pan. Other parameters are accessed by  
enabling their corresponding Function switch on the Process Module, then adjusting th e parameters on the Knob Module. Param-
eters assigned to a Knob Module can also be flipped to the faders. 
To adjust track volume: 
1Bank the track so it appears on a strip. 
2Adjust the fader. 
To adjust track pan: 
• S6: Rotate the knob on the Process Modu le for the desired track. If Pan is not shown on the Process Module, hold down the 
Back  switch directly below the Proce ss Module knob and then press the Pan switch. 
• S4: Focus the desired strip, press the Pan function select switch on the same CSM, then rotate the desired Pan knob. 
To adjust a plug-in parameter, send, or other parameter:

Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 123Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 
The S4/S6 Master Post Module is a traditi onal film monitoring panel that lets you sw itch track monitoring between input sources  
and punch tracks into and out of record. A comprehensive Speaker/ Monitor Control section is provi ded, along with a bank of cus-
tomizable Soft Keys and st rip Link and Lock controls. 
Master Post Module (MPM) strips  can have any type of DAW track assigned to them. Tracks are assigned to MPM strips from the 
Tracks/Layouts page. These and all MPM operat ions are provided in the following sections. 
•Master Post Module Top Panel
•Assigning Tracks to MPM Strips
•Track Monitoring and Recording
•Linking and Locking Strips
•Using the Speaker Controls
•Using the Soft Keys
Using Multiple Master Post Modules
When more than one MPM is installed in a sy stem they can be configured to mirror each  others tracks or to work independently. 
• When the Tracks > Local Option  setting Meter Layouts  is enabled, all Master Post Modul es’ tracks act as a single, mirrored 
unit. Track assignments are mirrored (ide ntical) on all Master Post Modules. 
• When disabled, each Master Po st Module acts independently of other Master Post Module s. In the Strip scroller ( Post Lay-
outs) unique Master Post Module strips ar e displayed for each module and numbered  according to the current setting for 
Number of Post Strips in Post Layout . Different tracks can be a ssigned, recalled, and contro lled to or from each module.
Using MPMs in Multi-Operator Configurations
In systems with more than one MPM and only one recorder, make sure all MPMs are connected to the S6 that is connected to the 
recorder. This includes multi-operator conf igurations. For more information, see the S6 Networking Guidelines.pdf , available for

Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 125Assigning Tracks to MPM Strips
Tracks are assigned to MPM strips from the Tracks screen in Assign Post mode. MPM track assignments are managed in 
Post Layouts, and are unaffected by standard surface banking or nudging. 
To assign tracks to MPM strips: 
Recall a Post Layout containing MPM assi gnments. You can recall Post Layouts from the MPM Soft Keys or from the Master 
Module Tracks screen in A ssign Post mode (see next). 
To assign tracks to a Post Layout: 
1Navigate the touchscreen to the Tracks screen. 
2In the Navigation Switch section of  the Master Module, press and hold Shift . 
On the Tracks screen, the Assign  button becomes Assign Post . 
3While still holding Shift  tap Assign Post . 
The Assign Post  button lights purple and the lower strip scroller  shows Post strips (Post 1, Post 2 and so on). 
4Assign tracks to MPM strips as you  would in a standard Track layout. 
• Tap Track blocks in the upper track matrix to select the tracks you want in the Lay out, then tap a strip block at the bottom o f 
the screen to place the currently sele cted track(s) starting on that strip. 
• Repeat to add and arrange other tracks in  the Layout. To include tracks from a diff erent application or workstation, focus tha t 
application and then repeat the previous steps to add its tracks to the Layout. 
• Swipe the lower strip scroller to the left to access additional MPM strips (if any, as determined by the Number of Post Strips 
in Post Layout  setting and/or the number of MPMs in your system). 
• When you have select ed and placed tracks onto strips, tap Store . The Store Post Layouts  grid appears. 
In the lower Strip scroller, all strips (scr oller at the bottom of the screen) are outlined in bright  green, indicating they wi ll be 
stored and recalled with the Layout. Tap to de select the strip blocks for any strips you do not want stored in and recalled with the 
Post Layout.
• Tap a block in the Store Post Layouts grid. The block highlights and is automatically numbered, and Store  appears at the far 
right of the Layouts Commands across the bottom of the screen. The Layout Name fiel d also appears with a flashing cursor. 
• To store the Layout with only its assigned number for its name, tap Store . To enter a custom name fo r the Post Layout tap the 
Layout Name  field, enter a name using the on-screen keyboard, then tap Enter .
To exit Assign Post mode: 
Press Assign Post  again, or press the Attention  or Select  buttons on the Tracks screen.

Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 126Post Layouts
MPM track assignments are not stored in standard track Layouts but are instead mana ged in separate Post Layouts . Just like stan-
dard Layouts, Post Layouts are maintained in Titles and sessions, can be saved, loaded, renamed, and edit ed. When a Display Mod -
ule is configured as a Master Post Displa y Module (MDM) and linked to an MPM, Post Layouts also let you assign tracks as the 
PEC and DIR meter sources. 
Post Layouts and Virtual Strips
The Number of Post Strips in Post Layout  setting in the Tracks > Local Options scre en lets you define how many virtual strips 
to include in Post Layouts, so that Post Layouts are not limited in size to the numbe r of physical MPM strips in a system. When  
saved, Layouts save the maximum number of po ssible virtual strips. For example, with Po st Layouts you can define up to 80 virtu al 
strips, so saved Post Layouts maintain 80 strips. This prevents Post Layouts from losi ng any assignments if transferred to and 
loaded on a system with fewer MPMs or vi rtual strips than the original system. 
Once you add virtual strips they are not remo ved or deleted; reducing the number of Po st Strips merely hides the previously ava il-
able strips and they are no longer visible. They are not editab le but by default are saved to Titles and sessions. You can cont rol 
whether hidden virtual strips are retained using the Store Hidden Virtual Strips in Layouts  setting. 
Banking and Spilling Strips
The MPM provides bank left and right switches to  bank tracks across MPM strips. These switches ( < and >) become available when 
the currently recalled Post Layout includes more than 10 strips, or when a VCA with mo re than nine member tracks is spilled. 
MPMs bank independently of the rest of the surface. 
To bank the MPM: 
1Recall a Post Layout with more than 10 tracks, or spill a VCA (assigned to an MPM strip) that has more than 10 member tracks. 
2On the MPM, press < to bank left or > to bank right. 
To spill a VCA on the MPM: 
1Recall a Post Layout or bank the MPM so  that a VCA appears on an MPM strip. 
2Make sure the MPM master Link  switch (upper left corner) is off/disabled. 
3In the MPM strip for the VCA, press the Link  switch (at the top of the strip controls). 
The member tracks of the VCA spill across as many MPM strips as necessa ry. If there are more than ten, press < or > to bank 
the MPM. 
4To unspill, press any strip Link  switch. 
VCA Spill on an MPM does not support nested VCAs. VCAs can only be spilled one layer deep. 


Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 127Track Monitoring and Recording

6To punch out, push the MPM Record paddle down (Off). At the time of this writing, the MPM re quires Pro Tools 12.5.2 or higher for basic functionality.  Some features require 
Pro Tools 12.6 or higher. For other DAWs, contact thei r manufacturer. 
Pro Tools indicates DestructivePunch- and TrackPunch-enabled status by  flashing Record Enable LE Ds in alternating red and 
blue. You can configure the MPM to always i ndicate record status with Pro Tools colors  or to use only red by enabling or disabli ng 
the Use Pro Tools Track Record Mode Colors  preference in the Settings > User page. 


Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 128VCA Punch Recording
MPM Record Ready switches arm a nd disarm Pro Tools tracks incl uding slaves of VCAs, and indicate Ready status of tracks, 
VCAs, and slaves of VCAs, without requi ring any modifier keys be engaged while toggling Record Ready status. 
While the Transport is stopped: 
• Pressing a Record Ready switch record en ables the corresponding Pro Tools track; pressing again record disables the track. 
• Pressing a Record Ready switch on a VCA places all its member tracks into Record Ready. When the VCA is in Record Ready 
you can spill the VCA and disarm individual slaves. The Re cord Ready switch on any VCA arms and disarms all slaves. 
The MPM Record Ready switch LEDs  light red when the corresponding Pro Tools trac k Record Enable button is in any of the fol-
lowing states:
Linking and Locking Strips
The MPM provides several types of strip Linking, to be able to co ntrol functions on multiple strips in unison. Linking is maint ained 
for as long as the current session is open. You can also lock st rip 1 to its currently assigned track. All linking states are r ecallable 
with Post Layouts in S4/S6 19.5 or later. 
Basic Link
In this mode, all linked strips respond in unison when the fo llowing functions are engaged on any of the linked strips: Ready, Re-
cord paddles (punch in/out), Solo, and Mute. 
To link strips: 
1Press the master Link  switch (in the upper left corner so that it flashes yellow. 
2Select strips to link by  pressing thei r individual Link  switches so that they flash yellow.

Chapter 13: Using the Master Post Module 130Using the Speaker Controls
The MPM provides a set of Speaker and mon itor control switches. The default assignment s for these switches are labeled on the 
switches, and include sp eaker select (such as Alt 1 , Alt 2 , and Main ), modes (such as Cut, Dim, Fold Down  and Insert ), and spe-
cial purpose switches such as Auto Match . Auto Match lets you punch out of an automation write pass. 
All switches in the Speaker Control section are Soft Keys that can be re-assigned and cu stomized in the Soft Key Editor by sele cting 
Post Module Soft Keys  from the module selector. 
Using the Soft Keys
Each MPM provides a bank of 15 Soft Keys below the Speaker Co ntrol switches. A defa ult (factory) set of MPM Soft Key assign-
ments is provided to let you recall Post Layouts, control monito ring options, and perform other frequently used functions. Like  all

Display Modules can be designated as Master Post Display Modules (referred to as MDMs) to prov ide dedicated PEC/DIR meter-
ing for associated Master Post Modules. Li nked states for Post Modules are also show n on MDMs, including Link master, master 
Record, and Link indicators (c hain) for each linked track.
Each Master Post Module can have its own MDM assigned to it. With S6 up to three MDMs can be use d, and with S4 one MDM. 
When two or three MDMs are designated, both can mirror each other. MDMs are configured in the Settings > Surface  page sim-
ilarly to how Master  Meter Display Module s (MMMs) are assigned. 
Tracks displayed on MDMs follow assignments  to Post Layouts in the expanded Post  Layout Assign screen. MDM views are 10 
tracks in width, matching the Master Post Module, and you can ch oose to display up to 4 rows of  10 meters. One additional, larg er 
view is available that provides two rows of  five tracks. Each MDM strip has up to tw o other tracks assigned as the source for i ts 
Input (DIR) or Output (PEC) meter. The two sources are distinguished by either blue and green (the default), or red and green. 
An orange outline indicates tracks currently banked on the MPM.Reminder: MDM = Master Post Display Modules. MMM = Mast er Meter Display Modules. MPM = Master Post Modules.

Chapter 16: Editing 142Chapter 16: Editing 
This chapter shows you how you can edit Pro Tools audio tracks using S4/S6. 
• On systems that in clude Display Modules, yo u can edit audio using Kn ob Modules or CSMs (see Editing from the Surface ). 
• All systems can use the Wheel and its surrounding switches, the Lo cate switches, and So ft Keys to select and edit clips (see 
Editing with the Wheel, Lo cate Switches, and Soft Keys ).
Editing from the Surface
(Display Module Systems with Pro Tools Only)
S4/S6 lets you edit clips using knobs and their Sel and In switches on Knob or Channel Strip Modules (or faders when Flip is en-
abled). You can move a clip, trim the head or tail, ad just Fade In and Fade Out, and adjust Clip Gain. 
Clips are targeted for editing when they reach the playhead on  the Display Modules when in any Waveform view as shown in 
Figure 19. Resolution of edits and moves using the Sel and In switches is determined by the Pro Tools Nudge value, which can also 
be adjusted directly from S4/S6. Edit s made by rotating S6 knobs use the current Knob Preference settings (see Knob Speed and 
Sensitivity ). 
Visual feedback is provided both in the Pro Tools Edit window  and on the channel Display Modul es by a variety of  yellow outline s 
that vary depending on the mode. 
To move or edit a clip: 
1Make sure Display Modules are conf igured in one of the available Wa veform views. If necessary, go to Settings > Preferences  
and select one of these views in the Display Module section.
2On a Process Module or CSM, press Edit on the strip you want to edit. The Knob Mo dule for that strip light in fuchsia and dis-
play edit parameters, the number  and type of which vary depend ing on track type as follows:
Audio Tracks Clip Gain, Move, Trim Back, and Trim Front, Fa de Out, Fade In, Nudge Amount, Undo and Redo.
Instrument and MID Tracks  Move, Trim Back, Trim Front, Nudge Amount, Undo and Redo.
Systems with two Knob Modules available for the strip can access all parameters simultaneously. On  other systems, press the lit  
> or < switch on the Knob Module to naviga te between pages of Edit controls. References to switches and displays on S6 F ader, Process, and Knob Modules also appl y to S4 CSMs unless noted otherwise. 
You can adjust the zoom resolution of the Wave form displays in Settings > Preferences, and qui ckly zoom out or in using the Dis -
play 1 and Display 2 switches on the Master Module. See Waveform Zoom . 
You can also enable Expand mode on that strip to  see all Edit parameter s simultaneously. See Expand f. 


Chapter 16: Editing 1433Cue the session so that a clip is in contact with the Display Module playhead. On the Display M odule, a yellow border or bracke t 
appears around any clip that is in contact with th e playhead on a strip in Edit mode (see Figure 19). 
Once a clip is targeted for editing it will remain the Edit ta rget until another clip on the sa me track crosses the playhead, o r until 
you enable Edit mode on a different track. 
4To adjust a value, do either of the following: 
• Press the Sel switch next to the knob to  increment (increase); press In to decrement (decrease).
• Turn the knob for that parameter clockwise to increment (extend or move later in the timeline ), or counterclockwise to dec-
rement (shorten or move earlier in the timeline). Turn slowly fo r fine adjustment and fast for coarse.
On-screen in the Pro Tools Edit Window, the targeted clip is outli ned in yellow as soon as you touch or adjust a knob, or press  
an edit switch (see Figure 20). Brackets appear when trimming or adjusting fades. 
On Display Modules, the waveform or icon shown varies  with the edit function being adjusted, as follows:
Clip Gain The waveform gets wider as Clip Ga in is increased, and narrower as it is decreased. See “1” in Figure 21.
Move The entire clip remains highlighted and moves late r in time (rotate encode r clockwise, or press Sel), or earlier 
(counter-clockwise, or press In). See “2” in Figure 21.
Trim Back and Trim Front A bracket appears at the tail of the clip (Trim Ba ck) or head of the clip (Trim Front). See “3” in 
Figure 21.
Fade In A bracket appears at the head of the clip, and the Fade In leng th is indicated by a horizontal line that moves as you adjust 
the Fade In value. See “4” in Figure 21.
Fade Out A bracket appears at the tail of the clip, while the Fade out le ngth is indicated by a horizontal line th at moves as you ad-
just the Fade Out value. See “5” in Figure 21.
Nudge Amount The Nudge value increases or decreases as you adjust the value. This Nudge Value is independent from the 
Pro Tools Nudge Amount, and is stored with the session. The S4/S6 Nudge value only affect s edits made using the S4/S6 Sel 
and In switches. Edits made by rotating S4/S6 knobs  use a fixed value an d knob acceleration. Figure 19. Indication of a clip targeted for editing 
Figure 20. Pro Tools indication of a clip targeted for editing from S6
Display Module Waveform views only show and edit audio clips, re gardless of the current Pro Tools Track view (for  example, you 
cannot edit MIDI notes from the surface).

Chapter 17: Plug-Ins and Sends 146Chapter 17: Plug-Ins and Sends
This section explains how to ed it plug-ins and adjust Sends. 
Plug-ins
Plug-ins can be accessed and adjusted fro m the Master Module, Knob Module, Proce ss Module, Channel Strip Module, or from a 
Fader Module. Plug-in parameter mapp ing depends on the selected knob set or Expand mode, as follows:
Inserts Knob Set  In the Inserts knob set, pa rameters are mapped according to the manu facturer’s specifications. Parameter map-
ping can vary between plug-ins,  even of the same type. 
EQ and Dyn Knob Sets  In the EQ and Dyn knob sets (as well as EQ or Dyn Expand  mode), parameter mappings are standardized 
across types of plug-ins. For example, the threshold controls for two compressor plug-i ns from different manufacturers appear o n

dows on Workstation When Knobs Assigned . 
Editing a Plug-in Usin g the Master Module
To edit a plug-in using the Master Module, yo u must first attention a track with a plug-in. 
To attention a track, do one of the following: 
From the Fader Module or CSM, press Attention  on the desired track.
From the Home screen, touch a track in th e Track Scroller or Meter Scroller (see Home Screen Options ).
From the Tracks screen, touch Attention, and touch a track in the Track Matrix. (R equires that the Track Selector option 
Auto-Bank to Attentioned Track  is enabled; see Track Selector Options .) 
To edit the plug-in the Function Editor:
1Touch Inserts  in the Function Scroller.
The names of plug-ins inserted on the Attention Track appear on the Attention Track Knobs.References to switches and displays on S6 F ader, Process, and Knob Modules also appl y to S4 CSMs unless noted otherwise. 
You can also adjust plug-ins using Expand m ode, in which multiple parameters are “spi lled” across one or more Knob Modules, 
or mapped to faders on a Fader Module. For more information, see Expand .

Bypassing Plug-ins on the Master Module
The In buttons next to the Lock icons in the Ho me page let you bypa ss plug-in inserts. 
• When lit green, inserts are acti ve (not bypassed). Tap either In control to bypass its currently attentioned plug-in. 
• When bypassed, In becomes gray, and so does the name of the bypassed pl ug-in(s) in the Function Scroller (whether expanded 
or collapsed). 
• When more than one plug-in is bypassed, In is highlighted in orange and the name s of bypassed plug-ins are dimmed in the 
Function Scroller. Tap IN again to bypass all plug-ins on the track (their names dim), and tap again to un-bypasses all. 
Editing a Plug-in Using the S6 Knob Module or S4 CSM Knob Section
Plug-ins can be edited using the Knob Module or CSM Knob section in  Inserts, EQ/DYN, or Expand mode. 
Inserts Mode Parameters are displayed four at a time  (on S4, or on S6 strips with one Knob Module) or eight at a time (S6 strips 
with two Knob Modules). 
EQ/DYN Parameter mappings are standardized ac ross types of plug-ins. For example, the threshold controls for two compressor 
plug-ins from different manufacturer s appear on the same encoder. 
Expand Mode Multiple parameters are “spilled” across one or more Knob  Modules, or mapped to faders on a Fader Module. For 
information on Expand mode and Auto Expand (which suppo rt many functions, not just plug-ins and sends) see Expand .
Insert Mode
To edit a plug-in using Insert Mode:
1S4 Only: Focus the desired strip (bank the desi red track to the surface then press its CSM Focus  switch so it is lit). Knob In and Sel switches control additional parameters. For example, in the EQ3 plug-in the In switch for gain controls toggle 
that band in or out. Similarly, the Sel switch for frequency controls  let you adjust Q (or slope, as  available) using that knob.

Chapter 18: Custom Knobs and Custom Faders 155Chapter 18: Custom Knobs and Custom Faders
Use Custom Knobs to arrange a nd save custom mappings of pl ug-in parameters to knobs ( Custom Knob maps ) or faders ( Custom 
Fader maps ) on supported EUCON control surfaces. Custom Knob maps le t you arrange parameters for each of your different EQ, 
dynamics, and other plug-in however you desi re. Custom Knob maps are compatible with  both EuControl and S4/S6 maps of the 
same size and can be transferred between systems. 
Custom Fader maps, introduced in a previous version of S6 soft ware, now use the same method to build maps as the new Custom 
Knob maps as described below. In addition,  Custom Fader maps can now include more than the previously available two pages, and 
plug-in bypass (In) is automatically mapped to the Track Color sw itch on strip 8. (Custom Faders are not supported with EuContr ol 
devices.) Note that any ex isting Custom Fader maps will need to be recreate d after installing 2021.6.

or Make Secondary  to add the new parameter as a secondary (peer) knob. 
• Assign the parameter to a knob that alre ady has a toggle assignment (with both a primary and s econdary parameter), then 
choose Overwrite , Make Primary , or Make Secondary . 
Assigning multiple parameters to k nobs in one gesture overwrites any assignments on the destination knobs.
Reset Using Factory and Factory All
You can use the Factory  and Factory All  commands to clear the current map type and form fa ctor, or all form factors for the current 
map type, respectively. 
•Factory  only becomes available after you have se lected the type of map to create. Press Factory  to clear that map but leave 
all the other map fo rm factors in place (if any existed).
•Factory All  becomes available when you first press Custom , but before choosing the map ty pe (such as Master Module or 
Knob Module). Press Factory Al l to clear the entire map for the current function / DAW.
Plug-in Parameter Mapping for Inserts, EQ/DYN, and Custom
Plug-in parameter mapping depends on the se lected knobset (function), and whether you have created any custom maps, as follows:
Inserts In the default Inserts  knobset parameters are mapped according to th e manufacturer’s specifications. Parameter mapping 
can vary between plug-ins, even of the sa me type. Custom Knob maps created through Inserts will be displayed when accessing 
plug-ins through Inserts. 
EQ/DYN  In the default EQ and DYN  knobsets, parameter mappings are standardized  across types of plug-ins. For example, the 
Threshold controls for two compressor plug-in s from different manufacturers appear on th e same encoder. Custom Knob maps cre-
ated through EQ or DYN will be  displayed when accessing any/all EQ or DYN plug-ins through the EQ or DYN  functions. 
Custom Knobs  You can create Custom Knob maps  for both Inserts and EQ/DYN. 
• Whenever you access a plug-in through the Inserts  function, any custom knob map you creat ed for that specific plug-in are dis-
played. Select Action dialog



Chapter 18: Custom Knobs and Custom Faders 158• Whenever you access an EQ or dynamics plug-in through the EQ or DYN  functions, any custom maps you have created for any 
EQ or Dynamics plug-in using the EQ or DYN  functions will be disp layed. If you have not created custom maps using EQ or 
DYN , the default EUCON maps are used. 
• Only parameters in the current plug-in are available to add to a Custom Knob map. For example, if you create an EQ map using 
Channel Strip and then focus EQ3 7-band, the 5th band in EQ3 will  not be mapped since it does not exist in Channel Strip (and 
therefore could not have been mapped while creating the Custom  Knob map). To add a missing pa rameter, focus on the desired 
plug-in, re-enable Custom Assign mode, an d add the parameter. A blank knob labeled N/A appears in positions  that have a knob 
assigned that is not in th e currently focused EQ/DYN.
Show EQ and DYN Plug-Ins on Surface as Inserts...
(Pro Tools 2021.6 and later): If you want to use Custom Knob maps created in the Inserts  function when clicking on an EQ or Dy-
namics plug-in in Pr o Tools, enable the Show EQ and DYN plug-ins on surface as inserts if there’s an  Inserts Custom Map set-
ting in the Attention section of Settings > User . You must also enable Plug-Ins  under Attention Most Recently Clicked DAW 
Area  in the Attention section of Settings > User . When enabled, clicking an EQ or Dyna mics plug-in on-screen displays its Cus-
tom Knob map on the surface as determined by the Home screen option Open Windows on Workstation When Knobs Assigned 
(such as the Master Module or Expand Knob module). 
Auto Load / Clear Custom Knob Maps
S4/S6 provide two settings to control how Custom Knob and Cust om Fader maps are handled when  sessions are opened and closed. 
These settings are located in the Auto-Load From Titles And Sessions  section of Settings > System . 
Custom Maps can be loaded from sessions by  enabling the Auto Load Custom Knob and Fader Maps From Sessions . When en-
abled and a new session is opened, maps are merged (any plug-in map already on the syst em and in the session  will be overwritte n).
Custom maps can be cleared from S4/S6 when sessions are closed by enabling the Clear Custom Maps When Session Data 
Clears  setting. 
Location of Custom Knob Map Files
Custom Knob map XML files are st ored in the following locations: 
• macOS: Go > (Option key) Library > Preferences > Avid > Consoles > KnobMaps• Windows: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppD ata\Roaming\Avid\Consoles\KnobMaps
Custom Knob Maps Stored in Titles 
Beginning in S4/S6 2022.12, Custom Knob Maps are stor ed in Titles in addition to any designated session. Show EQ and DYN... and Plug-Ins settings enabled in the Attention section of Settings > User
As with other Auto-Load options, this featur e requires a workstation be designated fo r automatic store/reca ll (in Settings > Wo rk-
station, the workstation must have the blue star indicator) . For more information, see Autoload from Ti tles and Sessions . 
To avoid losing maps, be sure you have desi gnated a workstation for auto matic store/recall of layout s in Settings > Workstation s. 



Chapter 18: Custom Knobs and Custom Faders 159Custom Faders
In addition to using the Custom method to assign parameters to Custom Fader maps (d escribed above), Custom Faders provide the 
following: 
• Custom Fader maps can use more than 2 pages.  When in Expand Faders mode, use the lit User 1  and User 2  switches to nav-
igate to additional pages. 
• Custom Faders provide the plug-in In control (bypass) on the Track Color switch ( OK) in strip 8 in the Fa der Module designated 
as an Expand Fader module. 
• The Pan fader map has a special feature that lets you create and use one fader map for all Pan types. Any assigned Pan knob au -
tomatically tries to match the Mono version with the Stereo Left version of the knob. If you make  a fader map for Pan with ster eo 
pan knobs, but use that map for a mono trac k, all the “Left” stereo pan knobs in the map will match the mono versions. For ex-
ample, “Left Pan” in the custom fader map will show “Pan.” Simil arly, if you made a map with “Pan” then use it for stereo track s, 
“Left Pan” is displayed on the surface.


Chapter 19: Assignable Knob 160Chapter 19: Assignable Knob
The Assignable Knob can be assigned to almost any on-screen Pro Tools continuous control, includ ing Clip Effects and AudioSuite  
plug-ins, to be able to keep control over a given parameter re gardless of window or controller focus. With the optional ability  to 
mirror the assignment to the Jog Wheel on the S4/S6 Master Module, the Assignable Knob  also lets you adjust a parameter with 
maximum resolution.
Note that while the Assignable Knob supports  almost any continuous control parameter th at can be automated, not all parameters 
in all plug-ins from all manufacturers full y support the Assignable Knob. Knob assignme nt persists in the current session only.  
On S4/S6, the Assignable Knob is located in the lower left corner of the Master Module. 
To assign a parameter to the Assignable Knob: 
1Do the following: 
• Pro Tools and Avid plug-ins: hover the cursor over  the desired parameter or  click directly on it. 
• Third-party plug-ins: clic k the desired parameter. 
On-screen in Pro Tools a blue highlight border appears around either the parameter being hover ed over, or the currently as-
signed parameter (if any)  as determined by the Pro Tools Preference for Display of Assignable Knob Control . 
On the Master Module the Assignable Knob li ghts in the function color that correspon ds to the hovered or currently assigned 
parameter and its display shows the parameter name. 
2Press the Assignable Knob to assign to  lock it to the current parameter. Make sure all to update to the latest ve rsions of all your plug-ins. While all Av id plug-ins support the Assignable Knob, at th e time 
of this writing not all third- party plug-ins do yet. If you find a plug-in t hat does not support the Assignable Knob contact th e man-
ufacturer for more information.

Chapter 19: Assignable Knob 1613Rotate the knob to adjust the assigned parameter, or press the Sel and In switches next to the Assignable Knob to increment and 
decrement, respecitvely. 
The parameter stays locked to the knob un til you re-assign a different parameter, or close the session. The Assignable Knob has  the 
same Automation Indicator LEDs as other encoders. 
Locking the Assignable Knob
By default, the Assignable Knob controls it s assigned parameter for as long as you hov er the mouse over that parameter. Lock a 
parameter to the Assigna ble Knob so that you can maintain control of the assigned parameter regardless of where you navigate to  
in Pro Tools. Unlock the Assignable Knob so that you can “sof t assign” the knob to any parame ter you hover over or click. 
To lock or unlock the Assignable Knob: 
Press the Assignable Knob to toggle the A ssignable Knob between locked or unlocked. 
Adjusting the Assignable Knob Usi ng the Automation Module Jog Wheel 
You can use the Jog Wheel to adjust the current Assignable Knob parameter with greater resoluti on. Automation mode and Lock 
status is indicated by LEDs surrounding the wheel. 
To duplicate the Assignable Knob to the Jog Wheel: 
1With a parameter already assigned, press the Back  switch below the Assignable Knob. The Jog Wheel now also controls the 
assigned parameter. 
2Rotate the wheel to adjust the parameter. LEDs light to indicate parameter value or position. When in automation Read mode the Read LED lights green, when in a Write mode the Write LED lights red, and when locked the Lock LED lights in the same function color as the Assignable Knob.

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 163Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing
This chapter shows you how to perfo rm the following tasks using S4/S6:
•Using Automation
•Mixing with VCAs
F (A) and M (T) Switches
Original Fader Modules labele d the two automation keys M and F. Current Fader Modules label these keys T (for Trim) and A (for 
Automation). Functionality is the same on both generations of Fade r Modules. In this and other guides, these switches are refer red 
to as M (T) and F (A) . 
Channel Keys and Automation
Using the Soft Key Editor you ca n customize the assignments for channel keys  (Fader Module switches surrounding the track 
OLED (display) such as Select , Swap , M S, Menu , and L G, as well as the F (A)  and M (T)  switches). 
Custom channel keys let you put  commands you use most often directly onto Fader Module strips. Both the Attention and Menu  
switches are available as modifiers for up to three “layers” per hardware switch (one  default layer, one layer accessible while  the 
strip Attention switch is held  down, and anot her while strip Menu  is held down). You can also customize Automation mode cy-
cling, engage Auto Take Over , and more. 
Use the rest of this section to learn how to work with automati on from S4/S6 default key assignme nts. To learn how to customize  
automation controls, see Customizing Automation Mode  Selection and Cycling . References to switches and displays on S6 F ader, Process, and Knob Modules also appl y to S4 CSMs unless noted otherwise.

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 164Using Automation
You can set the track Automation mode from Fader Modules, from th e Attention Track fader, or usi ng a combination of Soft Keys 
and track Select  switches. Track meters indicate Trim automation and au tomation writing. On systems that include Display Mod-
ules, automation data  can be shown along with waveforms. 
Setting the Track Automation Mode
To set the track automation mode:
On a Fader Module or CSM, press F (A)  on the desired strip repeatedly to cycle th rough the automation modes. While writing 
in Latch mode, press F (A)  to Auto Match out. 
Or, on the Master or Automation Module Soft Keys, hold the So ft Key for the desired mode th en press a Fader Module/CSM 
F( A )  switch (or Select  switch) to set that track to that automation mode. 
To toggle Trim Automation on and off for a track:
On a Fader Module/CSM, press M. Or on the Master or Automation Mo dule Soft Keys, hold the Soft Key for Trim  and press a 
Fader Module Select  switch. 
This table lists automation mode LED indica tion for any knob or switch with automati on LEDs. 0 = unlit, 1 = lit, and * = flashe s

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 165Write Mode Locked Out from Fader Module F Key
When cycling through automation modes using the F (A)  key on Fader Modules/ CSMs, Write mode is not included. You can still 
assign Write mode from the surface by enabling the Soft Key for Write mode and pressing the strip F (A)  key. 
This helps protect existing automation by requiri ng a more explicit gesture to enable Write mode. 
Func Switch to Enable All Plug-In Automation
Pressing the Func  switch on a Process Module or CSM enables automation fo r all controls in that st rip’s currently focused EQ, 
Dyn, or Insert function. 
To protect automation data, pressing the Func  switch only enables (it does not toggle automation off). 
In addition: 
• When a plug-in is spilled to encoders, press and hold Control-Option-Command (Mac ) or Control-Alt-Start (Win) and touch 
the knob for any parameter to toggle it s individual automation enable state. 
• When in Inserts view (top level), press and hold Control-Op tion-Command (Mac) or Control-Alt-Start (Win) and press the In 
switch next to the desired plug-in knob top (such as the knob or slot showing EQ3-7Bnd ) to toggle automation enable of all 
controls in the corresponding plug-in on/off. 
Automation Trim Metering and Write Indication on Fader Strips
Strip meters on Fader Modules/CSMs (and th e Attention Track meters on the Automati on Module) show Trim automation and in-
dicate when automation is  being written in any Write mode other than Trim. 
Automation Trim Metering
• While writing an initial Trim pass, the Right meter lights the LED at 0 to indicate you are writing Trim automation. 
• While editing an existing Trim pass, the Ri ght meter lights LEDs above or below 0 to  indicate the underlying Trim value. 
On-screen in Pro Tools, this corresponds to the ye llow (Trim) or blue (Composite) automation line. 
Write Indication
Whenever a track is writing automation in any mode other than Trim, the Right meter lights the LED that corresponds to the un-
derlying automation level. For example, if  in a Touch write mode the LED indicates wh ere the fader will return when you release  
it. If a track is the slave of a VCA, the lit LED corresp onds to the blue automation line on-screen in Pro Tools.Toggling automation enable status of f can cause automation data to be deleted (Pro Tools warns you). 
In order for the meters to show Trim, th e Pro Tools preference for Coalesce Trim  Automation must be  set to Manually.

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 166Automation Indication on Display Modules
Display Modules indicate automation Writing and Previe w mode with red and green backgrounds, respectively. 
Automation Breakpoint Data on Display Modules
(Systems with Display Modules Only)
Display Modules can show automation da ta along with waveforms. When enable d, automation can be shown for in-
dividual parameters on one or more strips. You can set a va riable amount of op acity and control the left-to-right ori-
entation of displaye d automation data. 
At left, pan automation is shown on a Display Module strip.
To enable and configure automation data on a Display Module:
1Go to Settings > Preferences , and scroll to the Display section. 
2Touch the Layout  selector and choose any Waveform view. 
3Configure the following settings as desired: 
Show Automation When enabled, automation breakpoint  data can be shown on  Display Modules and cu stomized using the set-
tings for Reverse Automation Lanes, and Automation Opacity. 
Reverse Automation Lanes Inverts the orientation of displayed automation  data. (Pan is unaffected by this setting.)
Automation Opacity Adjusts the visibility of waveforms behind automation data. When off (0 percent), automation is shown as 
a single thin line. Raising the percen tage adds an increasingly opaque fill. 
To show automation data on a Display Module strip: 
1Hold down Ctrl + Command /Alt on a Fader Module/CSM. 
2Touch a fader or knob. 
In the corresponding Display Module strip, automa tion data for th e touched parame ter appears. 
To show automation data display on all strips: 
1Press and hold down Ctrl + Opt/Win + Command/Alt  on a Fader Module/CSM.
2Touch a fader or knob. 
On-screen in Pro Tools, the Track View for that track (or all tracks) shows the corres ponding automation data. For example, if you 
touch a Process Module knob while it is assigned to Pan, on-s creen in Pro Tools the corresponding track jumps to Pan view. 
To exit automation display mode on individual strips: 
1Hold down Ctrl + Command/Alt on a Fader Module/CSM. 
2Press the strip Select  switch on the Fader Module/CSM. 
To exit automation display mode on all strips: 
1Hold down Ctrl + Opt/Win + Command/Alt  on a Fader Module/CSM. Figure 30. Indication of Write (shown at left) and Preview (shown at right) on Display Modules

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 1672Press a strip Select  switch on the Fader Module/CSM. 
Switching On-Screen Pro Tools Track Views to Automation Data from the Surface
You can use S4/S6 to change on-screen Pr o Tools track views to show automation. 
To display automation data for a track in Pro Tools:
1Hold down Control + Command  (Mac) or Ctrl + Win  (Windows) on a Fader Module/CSM.
2Touch a fader or knob. 
The Track View for that track shows the corresponding automation  data. For example, if you to uch a an S6 Process Module knob 
while it is assigned to Pan, on-screen in Pr o Tools the corresponding track jumps to Pan view. 
Customizing Automation Mode Selection and Cycling 
Beginning in S4/S6 2022.12 you can use Channel Strip Keys  to optimize Automation mode se lection and cycling. You can spec-
ify which modes are or are not av ailable, and customize their order when cycling for faster mode selection. Modifier Lock layer s 
let you create and utilize multiple Automa tion mode setups. For example, if your wo rkflow only requires Re ad and Touch/Latch, 
you can use Channel Keys to make the channel F (A) switch toggle between only those two modes, and use the Modifier Lock “At-
tention” layer to access othe r modes you use less frequently. 
In addition, a new Auto Take Over mode is available (see Auto Take Over ). 
Punch out and Trim are not available for custom mode assignments or cycling in channel keys. If using an application other than  
Pro Tools, automation mode  selection is unchanged. 
Managing Automation Mode Selection and Cycling
To customize Automation mode selection: 
1Navigate the touchscreen to Settings > Soft Keys, then tap the Module Select or at the top of the page and choose Channel 
Strip Keys . (For more information, see Customizing a Channel Key ). You can also show (or hide) automation data on Display Modul es from the computer keyboar d by holding Control + Command 
(Mac) or Ctrl + Win (Windows) and then tapping a control on S4/S6. 
If the Display Module setting to Show Automation is enabled, autom ation also appears on the corresponding Display Module 
strips. For more information, see Automation Breakpoint Data on Display Modules .


Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 1682Select the F (A)  key in the hardware images at the top of the Channe l Key editor. The lower section of the editor shows the Au-
tomation Mode Cycles : list. 
3To filter any modes out of the Automation Mode Cycle list, tap to deselect them (remove the ch eck mark). By default, both 
Write  and Crossover (Steinberg only) are di sabled; tap and swipe the list up to reveal these options (o r, if you have re-ordered 
the list, whichever modes ar e below the default view). 
4To re-order the list tap and drag a mode up or down, or tap to select a mode then tap use Up/Down arrow to the right of the lis t.
Here is an example showing the list filt ered to toggle between Read  and Touch/Latch only (no othe r modes will be available 
from the channel strip F (A) key. 
5Optional: 
• To add a second layer of unique Auto mation Mode Cycle settings, enable Attention  in the Modifier Locks  section, then repeat 
the previous steps to configure the Automation Mode Cycle li st as desired. While mixing, pre ss and hold Attention on a strip 
to access the second layer of Au tomation Mode Cycle settings.
• To add a second layer of Channel Strip Key Commands  to the M (T)  switch, enable Menu  in the Modifier Locks  section then 
choose the desired command. Channel Key editor (1) showing F (A) selected (2) and the default Automation Mode Cycle selector (3)

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 169About the M (T) Switch The M (T) key default assignment cannot  be changed from Trim, but can have other comm ands assigned 
to it in the Attention  and Menu  layers (Modifier Locks). 
About Punch Out and Trim  Punch out and Trim are not available for custom mode assignments or cycling in channel keys. If us-
ing an application other than Pro Tools, automation mode sele ction is unchanged. 
Auto Take Over
(Requires Pro Tools 2022.12 or higher)
S4/S6 version 2022.12 or higher supports Auto Take Over. While movi ng a fader to write automation in any mode (including Trim) 
you can enable Auto Take Over to have th e track automatically drop out of automation  writing as soon as the level crosses over the 
previous, underlying automation level. 
To use Auto Take Over mode: 
1On the desired track(s) select Touch, Latc h, or Touch/Latch, or enable Trim mode.
2Begin playback and wr ite new automation. 
3While touching the fader, press F (A)  or M (T) to enable Auto Take Over mode. When  enabled, the automation indicator LED 
flashes rapidly. 
4To drop (punch) out of automation writing, m ove the fader to match the previous, underl ying automation. Or let go of the fader 
and press F(A)  or M (T) . 
If fader touch is released while Auto Take Over is active before crossing th e underlying automation leve l, normal Fader touch r e-
lease is applied. Auto Take Over is not available in Write  mode. 
Global ATO 
A Global ATO command is available as a Su rface Soft Key. By assigning this command to an available Soft Key you can quickly 
place all tracks that are currently in an au tomation writing mode into Auto Take Over. 
When Global ATO is active, LEDs for write- enabled tracks begin flashing quickly. Each  track can be matche d out separately by 
moving its fader ac ross the underlying automation level.
When in Latch and not touched with Global  ATO active, crossing the underlying automati on punches out. If th e fader is touched 
and released without crossing  the underlying auto mation it returns to writing in Latch.
Releasing a fader writing in Touch or Touch/Latch without  crossing the underlying auto mation level punches out.

Chapter 20: Automation and Mixing 170Mixing with VCAs
S4/S6 provides the following VCA features. 
Adjusting VCA Slave Levels
When a VCA is banked to the surface, you ca n adjust level of its slaves  from the S6 Knob Module, CSM knobs, or from the Master 
Module Attention Track Knobs. 
• From a strip, enable the Bus function on that VCA (press Bus on the S6 Process Module for that strip, or on S4 Focus a strip 
then press Bus). Use the strip < Page > switches to navigate to other slave tracks, or press Exp on that strip to have slaves take 
over the Knob Module (S6) or knobs (S4 CSM). 
• From the Master Module, first Attention the VCA a nd make sure the Home sc reen is displayed. Tap Bus in the Function 
Scroller to have all slaves appe ar on the Attention Track Knobs. 
VCA Spill
(Pro Tools Only) 
VCA Spill lets you quickly expand (or “spill”) VCA slave tracks to adja cent faders, or to spill zones. 
The M, S, and LG LED indicators on the Fader Module/CSM show whether the track is a Master (M) or Slave (S), and if it is in a 
Group (LG). The Menu, Select, and Swap (S6)/ Focus  (S4), and switches above the M/S and LG indicators let you spill/unspill. 
To spill a VCA from a strip: 
1On the Fader Module or CSM for a VCA strip, press and hold Menu. 
The strip display shows Zone L and Zone R below the S6 Select  and Swap  switches, or S4 Select  and Focus switches (re-
quires that spill zones have been configured in Settings > Surface ). The switches light yellow , and Spill L and Spill R appear 
above the two switches on either side of Menu . 
2While still holding Menu , do any of the following: 
• To spill the VCA to the left spill zone, press Select . 
• To spill the VCA to the right spill zone, press Swap (S6) or Focus  (S4).
• To spill the VCA to the strips to the left  or right of the master VCA (standard VCA spill), press either of the switches adjac ent 
to Menu  (above the M S indicators to spill to the left, or above LG to spill to the right). 
When spilled, the Menu  switch on the strip of the VCA master lights dark green, and the corresponding Spill switch 
(L or R) on the Master Module also lights dark green.
On spilled slaves, Menu  is light green if the option to  light them is enabled (see Spill Zone Menu Key Mode for Lay-
outs, Workstations or Types ). Spill Zones must first be configured in Se ttings > Surface. For more information, see Configuring Spill Zones .
You can also spill VCAs automatically when they  are attentioned. See Automatic Spill of Atte ntioned VCA or Folder .

The enabled L Spill  or R Spill switch on the Master Module is pink. On channel strips, Menu  switches within the enabled zone 
light in the same color as the enabled L Spill  or R Spill  switch if the option to light them is enabled (see Spill Zone Menu Key 
Mode for Layouts, Workstations or Types ). 
4To bank or nudge tracks within a sp ill zone, make sure the corresponding L Spill  or R Spill  switch is lit white (press if neces-
sary), then use the Bank and Nudge  switches on the Master Module. 
5To unspill, press Shift  + L Spill  or R Spill  on the Master Module, or press Menu  on any strip in the spill zone when the Menu  
keys are configured to unspill (see Spill Zone Menu Key Mode for Layouts, Workstations or Types ).
VCA Unspill
When working with VCAs that include other VCAs as members you can use the Menu  switch to unspill one level at a time, or to 
completely unspill and exit VCA spill. 
To unspill an individual VCA: 
Press a Menu  switch once. 
To unspill all VCA layers: 
Press and hold a Menu  switch for longer than one second. You can configure VCAs to spill automatically to zones or adjacent strips when the VCA is attentioned (see Automatic Spill 
of Attentioned VCA or Folder ).
Spill Zone banking commands are al so available as Soft Ke ys in the default Pro Tools assignm ents (along with other Surface com-
mands). You can navi gate spill zones by Banking from the Fader Module or CSM . 
Commands to collapse (unspill) the left and right spill zones are also av ailable as Soft Keys.

On the Master Module surround panner, tap a speaker to snap the panner to that spea ker position. When panning stereo tracks, th e 
Stereo Control and Visibility  controls determine which channel(s)  will respond to tapping a speake r; the response of other channels 
is determined by whether Link is enabled, and if so which Inverse Link setti ngs are enabled, if any. 
Adjusting Link and Inverse Pan Control from Channel Strips
You can control Pro Tools stereo pan Link and Inverse Link from S6 channel strips, and from the Master Module. 
To access stereo link controls from a channel strip:
1On S6, bank or nudge the surface to access a stereo or LC R track that is routed to a greater-than-stereo output. 
2Do any of the following to navi gate to the desired parameter ( Link, Inv P, Inv R, or Inv F/R ). Not all parameters are available 
in all track formats. 
• On the Process Module, make sure Pan is shown in the strip display and then press the encoder < or > switches to navigate the 
encoder to the desired parameter. 
• Press the Pan switch in that track’s strip, then press the Knob Module < or > switches to navigate to  the desired parameter. 
• Press the Pan function switch, then press Exp in that strip to en able Pan E xpand mode. 
3Press the encoder In switch for the desired para meter to toggle it on/off. 
Accessing Left/Right Rear via L/R Front + Sel
When the L or R Front parameter is mapped to a knob, press that knob’s Sel switch to reassign the knob to the corresponding chan-
nel’s Rear parameter. For example, when L Front is displayed on a Knob Module, pressing that encoder’s Sel switch maps L Rear 
to that encoder. Press the lit Sel switch again (it becomes unlit) to return the encoder to L Front. 
Linking F/R
You can link the Front and Rear pan positions. 
• When linked, Rear position follows Front position; if you pan th at channel front-to-back while li nked, it pans vertically. Au-
tomation is written to both front and rear L and R knobs. 
• When unlinked, panning the same channel front-to-back will follow the trajecto ry between the current front position 
(left-to-right) and the current rear position (left-to-right). 
To link Front and Rear: 
1Attention a mono or stereo track a ssigned to a mult ichannel output. 
2Navigate the Home screen, Knob Module or Process Modu le to their Pan function for the attentioned track. 
3Press the In switch next to the encoder assigned to Front  or Rear  (if the track is mono) or L (or R) Front  or Rear  if stereo. 
When linked ( In switch lit), adjusting the L (or R) Front  or Rear  parameter pans the channel front -to-back vertically. Any offset 
between front and rear is ignored. 
On the touchscreen, the L (or R) Front  or Rear  knob also indicates F/R link status. 
• When linked, the on-screen L (or R) Front  or Rear  knob lights solid blue. 
• When not linked, the on-screen L (or R) Front  or Rear  knob lights with a blue outline. These controls are also  available on the Mast er Joystick Module.

Chapter 21: Immersive and Surround Mixing 176Accessing Dolby Atmos Parameters 
You can control and automa te Dolby Atmos parameters from th e Master Module, channel strips, and the Master Joystick Module. 
The following sections show how to pan in Dolby Atmos from the Master Module in 2D or 3D / Theater Mode . Pan knobs, controls 
and indicators are similar wh en adjusting Pan from cha nnel strips. If  your system includes  an MJM, see also MJM Features for 
Dolby Atmos .
To access Dolby Atmos parameters: 
1Attention a track that is  routed to a Dolby Atmos bus in Pro Tools. If you r system includes an MJM,  the surround panner ap-
pears on one joystick if the track is mono, or both if the track is stereo. 
2For modules other than  an MJM, enable the Pan f unction on the desire d module by doing  the following: 
• On the Master Mo dule, navigate to the Home screen and drag the Pan function block down to display Pan in the touchscreen. 
• To use knobs and switches in a channel strip, press the S6 Process Module Pan switch in the strip for the desired track (on S4, 
Focus the desired st rip and press its Pan switch). Navigate the kno bs to specific Pan paramete rs by pressing the lit 
< or > switches on the Knob or Process Module or on the CSM. 
Dolby Atmos Panning on the Master Module
Dolby Atmos on the Master Module is similar to standard panni ng, with the addition a few Do lby Atmos-specif ic parameters.
Panning in Dolby Atmos involves the following steps: 
1Configuring Dolby Atmos Renderer communication and Pro Tool s bus/object assignment (see  Pro Tools documentation). 
2Configuring Dolby Atmos Parameters  (Room View , Zone Mask, Height Mode, Size and other settings) for each track. 
To pan automatically in three dimensions: 
Enable Wedge, Sphere, or Ceiling Height  Mode (see Selecting a Height Mode ) then do the following: 
• Drag the pan dot left or right to pan the element left-to-right, or use the Front  knob. 
• Drag the dot up (towards the top of the touchscreen) or down to pan to the front and r ear, respectively, or use the F/R knob. 
Height is automatically calculated based on  the current Height Mode and pan location. 
To control Height manually: 
Enable Freeform  Height Mode and do the following: 
• Press and hold Shift  on the Master Module, then drag the dot up or down  to increase or decrease He ight, respectively. Or use 
the Height  knob to increase and decrease height. You can press/hold and Shift  at any time to engage or disengage Height. To 
resume touch panning to front, le ft, right, or rear, release Shift . 
Manually Controlling Height From Knobs or the Touchscreen
On the touchscreen you can control Height via dragging by engaging Shift . 
To adjust Height from the touchscreen: 
1Set the Height Mode to Freeform  (see Selecting a Height Mode ). 
2Press and hold Shift  on the Master Module, then drag the pan dot up or  down to increase or decrea se Height, respectively. 
You do not need to press Shift  prior to panning; press/hold and Shift  at any time to engage or disengage Height. 
3To resume touch panning to front , left, right, or rear, release Shift . 


Chapter 21: Immersive and Surround Mixing 177Adjusting Height from the Touchscreen
While surround panning in the touchscreen you can use two-finger pi nch and stretch gestures to cont rol Height at the same time.  
Prior to S4/S6 2022.12 you could adjust Height from the touchscreen only by holding down the Master Module Shift  switch. 
To pan in surround: 
1Attention a track that has a multi-channel output or send , and focus the touchscreen on the panner for that track. 
2Touch the pan dot and move  it left, right, forward or back  (normal surround panning). While moving the pan dot with one fin-
ger, use another finger to “pinch” in ward to lower the current Height se tting, or outward to raise Height. 
While pinching or stretching to pan and ad just Height an indicator shows the zoom di rection and color of the pan dot being chan ged. 
If multiple pan dots are on the panner, the one closest to the center of your fingers when zooming will be grabbed.
Indication of Pan Height
When any Height Mode is enabled in standard (2D) view, the curre nt Height position is indicated by the size of the pan dot. The  
larger the pan dot, the higher the position. (N ote that Height is indicated differently in 3D / Theater Mode .)

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 183Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module
This section explains the following Master Joystick Module (MJM) operations: 
•Assigning Tracks to the Joysticks
•Assigning Tracks to the Joysticks
•Writing Automation w ith the Joysticks
•Constraining the Joysticks to X or Y
•Advanced Pan Parameters
•Assigning Other Paramete rs to the Joysticks
•Joysticks and Layouts
•MJM Features for Dolby Atmos
References to switches and displays on S6 F ader, Process, and Knob Modules also appl y to S4 CSMs unless noted otherwise. 


Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 184Assigning Tracks to the Joysticks
To assign a track to the joysticks: 
1Do either of the following: 
• On a Fader Module or CSM, press the Attention  key for the desired track. 
• On the Master Module, naviga te the touchscreen to the Tracks page and make sure Attention  is enabled, then touch a track 
block in the track matrix or track scroller. 
The attentioned track is assigned to the first (left) joystick. If the track has dual panners (such as with a Pro Tools stereo track) 
the left and right channels of the track are assign ed to the left and right joysticks, respectively. 
2To assign a different track to the first joystick, wait  two or more seconds and th en Attention the new track.
3To assign a track to the second joystick, Attention that  track within two seconds of  assigning the first track. 
The center screen shows the cu rrent pan position as a green dot. If the track is automation write-enabled, the dot is red.
4To pan, move the corresponding joystick. 
You can also use the encoders to co ntrol a single pan parame ter at a time. Use the encoder Page switches ( < and >) to navigate 
the encoder to the desired parameter. Figure 44. Attention tab in the Tracks screen
You can change the default timeout of two seconds by adjusting the Assign Right Joystick Timeout  setting. 
Joystick assignments can be stor ed and recalled with Layouts (see Joysticks and Layouts ).



Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 185Channel Switch and Encoder Sections
Each joystick provides channe l switch and en coder sections. 
Channel switches include Attention , Solo , Mute , Record Enable , and automation switches ( M and F), as well as a display, all 
of which function just like those on Fader Mo dules. Unlike ch annel displays on Fader Modules, however, those on the MJM show 
track Name but not values. 
Each encoder section provides a dual -function (press/rotate) knob, with In, Sel, Back , and Page ( < >) switches as found on Process 
Modules. On the MJM, the encoder se ction controls let you adjust pa n parameters only. The knobs and In switches have automation 
indicator LEDs. You can navi gate the encoders and displays to pa n parameters using the Page switches. 
Remember Joystick Knobs by Track
A new setting, Remember Joystick Knobs by Track,  is provided in the Knobs section of the Settings > User  tab. 
• When enabled, the assignment of pan pa rameters to MJM knobs is re membered and restored fo r each attent ioned track.
• When not enabled, attentioning a new track to either joystick inherits the knob assi gnments of the previously attentioned trac k. 
Locking Tracks to the Joysticks
You can lock joysticks to anchor  them to their current track assignment, unaffe cted by banking, nudging, spilling and Layout re call. 
To lock a strip on a Master Joystick Module: 
Press Attention + Menu  in the track controls for that st rip on the Master Joystick Module. Figure 45. Channel and encoder sections
While the MJM encoder controls access pan par ameters only, you can assign the joysticks to adjust othe r types of parameters. Se e 
Assigning Other Parame ters to the Joysticks . 



Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 186Writing Automation with the Joysticks
To automate pan or other parameters assigned to the joysticks: 
1Make sure the desi red type of automation is enabled. 
For example, in Pro Tools choose Window > Automation  and make sure Pan or other functi on types are enabled for automation. 
2Put the track into an automation Write mode (such as Touc h or Touch/Latch). 
On the joystick display, the pan dot turns red. 
3Begin playback and mo ve the joysticks. 
The Automation indicator LEDs flash red while automation is written. 
4To punch out, press the track F switch on the Master Joystick or Fader Module. 
Punching Automation In/Out with the In Switch
The In switch punches the joystick in, writing automation at its curren t location. Note that when a track is in a Touch write mode, 
the green LED on the In switch lights indicating that it is simulating a touch.  The system reacts as if you are holding a joystick, pre-
venting a normal pu nch out from the F key. To punch out, either touch the joystick, stop the transport, or press the In switch again.
In Touch automation mode the In switch punches the joystick out (if writin g). To punch out of Latch mode, press the F switch.
Instant and Pickup Modes for Automation Takeover
By default, joysticks begin writing new auto mation instantly while in Write mode, as soon as they are t ouched while in Touch, 
Latch, or Touch/Latch mode, or when they are punched in via their In switch. You can instead enable joystick Pickup Mode to en-
able “pass-through” writing, in which the joysticks only begin wr iting automation when they ar e moved onto (take over) the same  
position as existing automation. 
To enable Pickup mode: 
1On the MJM, press the Pickup Mode  switch so that it lights white. 
2Make sure the desired automa tion type is enabled, and that the assigne d track is in any automation write mode. 
On the Joystick Module display, the pan dot turns red. 
3Begin playback, then touch the corresponding joystick. 
As soon as you touch a joystick, the screen shows a semi-tran sparent white dot representing the current joystick position. Figure 46. Joystick screen while writing automation
Figure 47. Pickup mode joystick  indicator (white, at left) and existing pan position (red)



Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 1874To begin writing automation, use the joystick to move  the white dot so it is on top of the red dot. 
Automation writing begins. The Auto mation indicator LEDs flash re d while automation is written. 
5To punch out, press the F switch on the Joystick or Fader Module. 
Constraining the Joysticks to X or Y 
Both joysticks provide X and Y switches that toggle the corresponding axis on or off. These switches do not restrict physical m ove-
ment of the joysticks; they only determine how pan or ot her assigned parameters respon d to the joystick movement. 
X  When lit, the assigned parameter responds to jo ystick movement along th e X (horizontal) axis. 
Y  When lit, the assigned parameter responds to joystick movement along the Y (vertical) axis.
By enabling only one of these switches (X  or Y), you can constrain pan moves to a si ngle axis. For example, to pan an element f rom 
side Left to side Right without a ffecting its front/rea r location, disable Y. Moving the joystick left-to-ri ght pans the track from side 
to side only, while its front/rear position is unaffected by any vertical  movement of the joystick, similar to panning left-to- right us-
ing a single knob. 
When both switches are unlit, the joysticks have no affect on th e assigned parameter. Figure 48. X and Y enabled



Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 188Advanced Pan Parameters

1Attention a stereo or LCR track to assign its left and right signals to the two joysticks. 
2Do either of the following: 
• To use the dedicated Link switches, press any of the following so they be come lit to enable their function. 
• To use the MJM encoders, navigate to the desi red Link parameter by pressing either lit < or > (Page) switch until the desired 
Link parameter is shown in the Enco der display. Then press the encoder In switch so it is lit (to enable) or unlit (not enabled). 
1 – Pro Tools Stereo Link
The Link switch ( 1 in Figure 51) links or unlinks left and right channels of a stereo pair. 
• When lit, channels are linked. When Link is enabled but no I nverse modes are enabled, both channels respond identically 
when either joystick is moved. If an y Inverse mode switches are enabled, linking beha ves as described below. 
• When unlit, channels are unlin ked and can be independe ntly positioned using their corresponding joystick. In addition, any 
currently enabled Inverse pan modes are ignored. 
2 – Front/Rear Inverse
When enabled and lit, the Inverse Front/Rear switch ( 2 in Figure 51) inverts front and rear pan control linking. 
3 – Inverse Pan
When enabled and lit, Front ( 3 in Figure 51) inverts left and righ t pan control linkage across the front.

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 190Assigning Other Paramete rs to the Joysticks 
(Func X Y)
The Func X-Y switches enable joystick Assign mode, which lets you assign parameters fro m the track currently attentioned on 
each joystick to the X and Y planes. 
• X is the horizontal axis, where moving left to righ t adjusts parameters from low to high, respectively. 
• Y is the vertical axis, where moving from the bottom to the top adjusts parameters from  low to high, respectively. 
For example, you can use this capability to c ontrol plug-ins that ha ve their own panners. 
Parameter assignments to the joysticks are maintain ed for as long as the current session is open. 
To assign parameters: 
1Press either Func X-Y  switch. 
If parameters have already been assigned to the corresponding joystick (left or right), the switch LED lights solid green and t he 
names of assigned parameters are shown above the joystick display. 
If no parameters are assigned, it fl ashes green. Proceed to step 3. 
2On the MJM, press Shift + Func X-Y/Setup. 
The Func X-Y  switch LED flashes to i ndicate joystick Assign mode. 
3Touch any encoder on the attentioned track on a Process, Kn ob, Channel Strip, or Master Module to assign it to X. 
The parameter name and value appe ars at the top of the display. 
If only one function needs to be assigned to X, press Func X-Y again. The pan dot lights purple and Func X-Y lights solid green 
and stops flashing. 
4To assign a second pa rameter to Y , touch a nother encoder on the at tentioned track while Func X-Y  is still flashing. 
Parameter names and values are shown on the display temporarily replacing the spea ker icons, the pan dot lights purple, and 
Func X-Y lights solid green and stops. 
5Move the joystick to adjust  the assigned parameters. 
6To return the joysticks to controlling track pan, press Func X-Y again (the LED becomes unlit). 
7Press Func X-Y  again to return to controll ing the assigned parameters. 
You can also utilize the X and Y Enable sw itches while in joystick Assign mode. See Constraining the Joysticks to X or Y . 


Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 191Joysticks and Layouts
In Layout Assign mode, the strip scroller s hows the two joystick strips in their posit ion relative to the rest of the surface, labeled 
Joy 1  and Joy 2 . 
You can assign tracks to joystick strips just as you would normal strips, and track a ssignments are stored and recalled with La youts. 
When a Layout is first recalled, its assi gned tracks appear on the Joysticks. 
Attentioning different tracks afte r the recall puts those tracks on th e joystick(s) as in banking mode. 
Auto Select Joystick Strips when Storing Layouts
The new Tracks Local Option setting Auto Select Joystick Strips when Storing Layouts  determines the initial state of the joystick 
blocks when storing Layouts. The default setting is off. 
This setting only affects the initial state of the Joystick strip blocks (whether enabled or not). You can tap to include or ex clude them 
while storying the Layout.

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 193Dolby Atmos Panning on the Master Joystick Module
The MJM joysticks and knobs pan in Dolby Atmo s similar to standard surround  or stereo, with additional  options for manually con -
trolling Height, enga ging 3D/Theater mode, and rotating the room vi ew as described in the following sections. 
Panning in Dolby Atmos involves the following steps: 
1Configuring Pro Tools bus/object assignment and Dolby Atmos Renderer communication as described in your Pro Tools docu-
mentation. 
1Attentioning a track that is routed to  a Dolby Atmos bus in Pro Tools, to a ssign that track to the MJM. (See also Assign Right 
Joystick Timeout ). 
2Configuring stereo Link settings if desired (Atmos  parameters follow  Link state but not Inverse settings).
3Configuring Dolby Atmos Parameters from the Master Joystick Module  for each track. 
To pan automatically in three dimensions: 
1Enable Wedge, Sphere, or Ceiling mode (see Selecting a Height Mode from the MJM ) then do the following: 
• Move the joystick left or right (X axis) to pan left/right, or use the Front  knob. 
• Move the joystick up or down (Y axis) to pan front/rear, or use the F/R knob. 
Height is automatically calculated based on  the current Height Mode and pan location. 
To adjust Height manually, see Manually Controlling Height from the MJM . 
Manually Controlling Height from the MJM
You can control Height from MJM k nobs, or using a joystick by enabling Height Adjust mode. 
To control Height from an MJM knob: 
1Attention a Dolby Atmos track to  assign it to a joystick. 
2Enable FreeForm  Height mode by pressing that joystick’s Shift  + Mode/X switches repeatedly until the 
FreeForm  icon is displayed above the MJM panner grid. 
3Press a lit < or > switch next to the that joystick’s knob to navigate the knob to Height . 
4Rotate the knob to adjust Height. 
5Press the knob’s In switch to toggle Height on/off. When lit gree n, Height is on; when unlit Height is off. Figure 56. Knob section for le ft joystick, assigned to Height

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 194To control Height from an MJM joystick: 
1Attention a Dolby Atmos track to  assign it to a joystick. 
2On the MJM, press Shift + Alt 1/Y  in the switches above the joystick assigned to the desired track (see 2 in the figure below). 
The opposite joystick becomes a Height cont rol (Z axis), with the current Height va lue displayed above. Th e attentioned joystic k 
continues to control X/Y pan. In addition:
•Freeform  Height mode is automatical ly enabled for the track, and Height  is also enabled if it was off. 
• The knob below that joystick maps to Size. 
3Enable or disable Pickup mode for the joysti ck now assigned to Height by pressing its Pickup Mode  switch: 
• When enabled, the Pickup Mode  switch is lit white indicating the joystick is in  Pickup (pass-through) mode. In this mode a 
white circle appears in the Hei ght panner grid representing the current physical position of the joystick. Height  will not be 
changed until you move the joystick so the white circle joins th e green dot (the green dot repres ents the current Height value) . 
• When disabled, the Pickup Mode  switch is unlit indicating Takeover mode. In this mode, Height is changed as soon as the 
joystick is touched. 
4To increase Height move the Height joysti ck up. To decrease Height move it down. 
In the MJM panner grid the pan dots become larger as Height is increased, and smaller as Height is decreased. The current Heigh t 
value 0–100 is shown above the MJM pan grid assigned to Height. 
5To exit Height mode, press Shift + Alt 1  again or attent ion a new track.Figure 57. MJM panner grid in Height Adjust mode; a mono track at  front/center, Height at minimu m (0) / joystick 2 all the way down

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 195Configuring Dolby Atmos Parameters from the Master Joystick Module
(View Mode, Zone, Height Mode, Size, Height, and Speaker Snap)
You can control and automate Dolby Atmos parameters using the joysticks, knobs, and switches on the MJM. The following in-
structions assume you have already attentioned a track that is assign ed to a Dolby Atmos bus in Pro Tools. 
Selecting the View Mode
The MJM panners can be viewed in standard 2D mode, or in 3D/Theater mode, separate ly from the Home screen Pan view on the 
Master Module. MJM View mode , room rotation  (if any) and other 3D settings are stored  in and recalled with User Preferences.
To toggle View Mode on the MJM: 
Do either of the following: 
• Press Setup  below the two panner grids. When the Setup  switch LED is lit, Theater mode is displayed on the MJM. 
The MJM Setup  switch does not change view mode on the Master Module. 
\
• Go to Settings > User , and in the 3D Panner section enable or disable the Use 3D Panner on Joystick Module  setting. 
MJM 3D on/off is availa ble as a Soft Key. 
Rotating the Room View from the MJM
You can rotate the 3D room view for “top down” or other alternate views using a joystick, or using 3D Panner  settings. Rotation 
is global, affecting 3D panner vi ew on all tracks (not just the currently atte ntioned track) on the MJM and Master Module. The 3D 
Panner Preferences section also provid es a setting to optimize how tracks are assigned to pairs of joysticks. 
To rotate the MJM 3D view using a joystick:
Press and hold Setup , then move the corresponding joys tick to rotate its room view.

Chapter 22: Using the Master Joystick Module 196Assign Right Joystick Timeout
The Assign Right Joystick Timeout  setting determines the time window within which attentioning an additional track assigns that 
track to the right joystick, let ting you optimize how tracks can be assigned to  the different joysticks on Master Joystick Modu les. 
In previous versions of S6 software the joystick timeout was fixed at two seconds. At tentioning two tracks within two seconds o f 
each other assigned the first a ttentioned track to the left joystick and the se cond track to the right joystick. Attentioning t he second 
track two or more seconds after  attentioning the first track assigned that second at tentioned track to the left joystick (replacing the 
previously assigned track). 
You can now specify the time rang e for joystick assignment to between 0 and 3 seconds in Set tings > User . 
• A setting of 0/Off means the right j oystick will not be assigned to a diff erent track than the left joystick. 
• Any setting of 0.25 seconds or higher sp ecifies the time window in which attentioni ng an additional track assigns that track 
to the right joystick. 
Selecting a Zone from the MJM
To select a Zone from the MJM: 
1Press a lit < or > switch next to the channel encoders  of the appropriate joystick until Zone Mask appears on a knob. 
2Rotate the knob to sele cted the desired Zone. 
3To toggle Speaker Snap on/off, press the In switch next to the Zone Mask knob. 
Selecting a Height Mode from the MJM
To select a Height Mode from the MJM: 
1On the MJM switches above the joystick curren tly assigned to the at tentioned track, press Shift + X/Mode  to cycle through 
available Height  Modes (see 1 in the figure below). The current Height Mode is indi cated above the MJM panner grid.
2If you want to turn Height off from the MJM, press a lit < or > switch to navigate the channel encoder to Height  (not Height 
Mode), then press the lit In switch next to the Height knob. When unlit, Height is off.Figure 60. Settings > User, Joystick Strips section

You can adjust Size from the MJM using the channel knobs next to either joystick.
To adjust Size from the MJM: 
Press a lit < or > switch next to the channel encoders  of the appropriate joystick until Size is displayed. 
Or enable MJM Height mode. Size is automatically mapped to  the channel knob when the MJM  is in Height mode (see Manually 
Controlling Height from the MJM ). 
When Size is set to any value above 0/off, a transparent grid surrounds the corresponding pan dot  standard 2D view, or a transp arent 
cube in 3D/Theater mode. The grea ter the Size setting, the larger th e grid/cube. For an example, see Indication of Size .
Toggling Speaker Snap On or Off
You can toggle Speaker Snap on or of f for tracks assigned to an Object. 
To toggle Speaker Snap on or off from the MJM: 
1Press the lit < or > switches next to the channel encode rs of the appropriate joystick until Zone Mask appears on a knob. 
2Press the lit In switch next to the Zone Mask  knob. When In is lit, Speaker Snap is on. When unlit, it is off. 
Do not confuse Dolby Atmos Speaker Snap with  the Pro Tools panner ability to click a speaker icon to “jump” the pan dot to a lo -
cation. 


Chapter 23: Layouts 198Chapter 23: Layouts
S4/S6 supports multi-workstation and multi -DAW track Layouts. Any tracks from mult iple DAWs can be arranged on the surface 
simultaneously. S6 M40-based systems suppor t connection to up to eight connected workstatio ns, while other S6 and all S4 sys-
tems support up to two connected workstations. Up to 96 unique Layouts can be stored and recalle d from the touchscreen or Soft 
Keys. Layout sets can be automatically saved and loaded to/fro m a designated application on a connected workstation, and manu-
ally exported and imported to/from disk for transfer and archiving. 
Layouts Mode versus Banking Mode Banking mode is the default, and lets you access all tracks from one DAW across the sur-
face. In contrast, Layout mode le ts you arrange any tracks from any connected DAW on as many (or as few) strips as you want. Yo u 
can use spill zones to spill Layouts to the surface without affect ing banked tracks outside the zone. For more information, see  
Chapter 25, “Spill Zones.”
Accessing Layout Mode
To enable Layout mode to immediately begin assigning tracks: 
1In the Tracks screen, tap Assign . On the Master Module, the Layout  Mode  switch LED lights blue. On the touchscreen, the As-
sign button becomes enable d and Layout commands Insert, Delete Strip, and Clear Strip replace Record , Input , Solo , and 
Mute . 
2Select and assign tracks to Layouts (see Creating Layouts ). After learning how to create standard Layouts, see the following: 
• If your system includes Master Post Modules see Assigning Tracks to MPM Strips . 
• If your system includes Master Meter Modules, see Using Master Display Meter Modules . 
• If your system includes Master Post Display Modules for PEC/DIR metering, see Using Master Post Display Modules
To enable Layout mode without automatically enabling Assign mode: 
1Do any of the following: 
• Press Shift  + Layout Mode on the Master Module. 
• Press Layout Mode  on the Master Module, then press a Soft  Key to recall the corresponding layout. 
•T a p  Recall  on the screen and recall a layout from the touchscreen. 
•T a p  Load  on the screen and load a saved set of Layouts. 
The Layout  Mode  switch LED lights blue. On the touchscreen, Record , Input , Solo , and Mute commands remain available. 
2If you want to enable Layout Assign mode, tap Assign  in the Tracks screen. 
To exit Layout mode: 
Press Shift  + Layout Mode . The surface returns to showing all tracks from the currently focused workstation. 
To exit Layout Mode after recalling a Layout from the Soft Keys: 
Press the Soft Key for the currently reca lled Layout. 
The User setting Auto Close Surface Recall Soft Keys determines whether or not  the Soft Keys return to their previous view 
after recalling a Layout. Fo r more information, see Auto Close Surface Recall Soft Keys .Check out the Avid Pro Tools | S6 Workflows  on YouTube for in-depth explorations of how to use S4/S6 , including Layouts, 
Spill Zones, Expand Zone s, and more. Check back fr equently for updates to this ongoing series. 
Keep in mind that whenever the surface ente rs Layout mode, only tracks from the curr ent or previously recalled layout appear 
across the strips. If you want to work with  tracks from a layout while maintaining ac cess to unassigned st rips, spill the layou t to 
a spill zone. For more information, see Spilling Layouts, Tracks, and Workstations . 


Chapter 23: Layouts 199To exit Layout Mode by spilling a Track Type: 
On the Master Module, press Type  and then select a Track Type (such as All,  Audio, or MIDI) by pressing the corresponding 
Soft Key. The surface switches to Banking mode with the selected Track Type on the strips.

Chapter 23: Layouts 200Virtual Strips
You can specify the number of strips available for track a ssignment in Layouts from the Tr acks Local Options screen. 
• Adjusting the Number of Strips in Layout  setting lets you include more tracks in  Layouts than availa ble physical strips. 
• Adjusting the Number of Post Strips in Post Layout  setting lets you include more tracks in Post Layouts than available phys-
ical strips on Ma ster Post Modules. 
Once you add virtual strips they are not re moved or deleted; reducing the number of st rips (or Post Strips) merely hides the pr evi-
ously available strips and they are no longer visible. They are not editable but by default are saved to Titles and sessions. Y ou can 
control whether hidden virtual strips are retained using the Store Hidden Virtual Strips in Layouts  setting. 
When a Layout that includes virtual strips is recalled, all su rface banking controls are availa ble to bank and nudge across the  surface 
or spill zone. 
To configure virtual strips: 
1Navigate the touchscreen to the Tracks scre en, and tap the Local Options (gear) icon. 
2In the Tracks Local Options screen, adjust the Number of Strips in Layout  slider to the desired valu e between 8 and 256 strips.
The next time you enter Assign m ode from the Tracks screen, the lower Strip scroller will show th e number of strips you selecte d. 
Drag the scroller left and right to naviga te to strips outside of the current view. 
You can change the Number of Virtual Strips  setting at any time. For example, if the current session was saved on an S4 or S6 s ys-
tem with 96 virtual strips and is then opened on a system with 64 virtual strips go to the Trac ks screen Local Options and incr ease 
the Number of Virtual Strips in Layout  to 96 to access the addition strips 65–96 in Layouts. 
Post Layouts
For systems that include one or mo re Master Post Modules, Post La youts let you assign and recall tracks to MPM strips. Post Lay -
outs are managed separately from standard Layouts and Titl e files. This means that you can cr eate, edit, save, and load Post La youts 
for the Master Post Module separa tely from standard track Layouts. 
For more information, see Using the Master  Post Module. 
Meter Layouts
Up to two Display Modules can be designat ed as Master Meter Modules (MMM) or a Master Post Display Module (MDM) to pro-
vide dedicated me ter displays for important sessio n elements. When two MMMs are desi gnated, both mi rror each other.
You can configure MMMs to show meters, waveforms, or meters an d waveforms for 8 to 32 tracks (up to four rows of 8 tracks 
each). You can select MMM view s separately from Di splay Module views, store MMM views in Meters Layouts , and link Meters 
Layouts to Track Layouts. 
For more information, see Using Master Display Meter Modules . 
Display Modules can also  be designated as Master Post Di splay Modules (referred to as MDMs) to provide dedicated PEC/DIR 
metering for associated Master  Post Modules. Linked states for Post Modules  are also shown on MDM, including Link master, 
master Record, and Link indicators  (chain) for each linked track.
For more information, see Using Master Post Display Modules . Number of Strips in Layout and Number of Post St rips in Post Layouts settings in Tracks Local Options



Chapter 23: Layouts 201Creating Layouts
Layouts are created by enabling Assign mode , selecting tracks in the matrix, and assi gning them to strips in the lower strip sc roller. 
To create a Layout:
1Tap Assign in the Tracks screen to en able Layout Assign mode. 
Insert, Delete Strip, and Clear Strip  appear to the right. 
When Layouts mode is enabled and its Assign  switch is active (referred to as Assign mo de), only tracks from the current or most 
recently recalled layout appear on the surface. 
If you are creating the first Layout, the strip scroller across the bottom of the screen will be blank, as will strips on the s urface. 
Otherwise, tracks from the last re called Layout (if any) are displayed. 
• If you want to remove only specif ic tracks from the new layout tap Clear Strip to enable it, then tap the tracks you want to re-
move in the lower scroller. Tap Clear Strip again to disable it. 
• If you want the new Layout to include co mpletely different tracks press and hold Shift  in the Navigation section of the Master 
Module; Clear Strip  becomes Clear All . While still holding Shift , tap Clear All  to remove all tracks from the scroller.
2Tap Track blocks in the upper track matrix to  select the tracks you want in the Layout. 
When tracks are selected in the Layouts sc reen their outlines are gree n as shown in Figure 64. Once any tracks are selected, a b ut-
ton Select None  appears; tap it if you want to cl ear the current selection of tracks. 
3Tap a strip block at the bottom of th e screen to place the currently sele cted track(s) star ting on that strip. 
On systems with Virtual Strips  enabled, or with 16 or more fa der strips, swipe the lower strip scroller, or the Strip Universe 
scroller, to navigate  to other strips beyond those shown. You can also create a layout co nsisting of all or all selected tracks currently banked onto the su rface. For more information, see 
Creating New Layouts Based on Currently Banked Tracks . 
Figure 63. Assign mode enabled in the Layouts screen
Figure 64. Three tracks selected to add to the Layout (green outline)
You can spill selected tracks to spill zones. For more information, see Spilling Selected Tracks to a Zone .
Figure 65. Selected tracks mapped to strips 1–3



Chapter 23: Layouts 202When you tap on a strip block, the currently  selected tracks are placed on the surface st arting on that strip, in the order in which 
you selected them (not in their ab solute track order). For example: 
• If four tracks (1–4) are selected and you tap the first (left-most) strip block, the se lected tracks are placed on strips 1–4.  
• If four tracks (1–4) are selected and you tap the fifth strip block, the selected track s are placed on strips 5–8. 
• If you first select track 4, then select tracks 1, 2 and 3, when you tap a strip in the strip block tr ack 4 will be placed on that strip, 
followed by tracks 1, 2, and 3. 
4Repeat the previous step s to add and arrange other tracks in the Layout. 
5To include tracks from a different application or workstation, fo cus that application and then re peat the previous steps to add  its 
tracks to the Layout. 
6When you have selected and pl aced tracks onto strips, tap Store . 
The Layouts grid appears. In the Strip scro ller, all strips (scroller at the bottom of the screen) are ou tlined in bright green  as 
shown in Figure 66, indicating they will be stored and recalled with the Layout. If your system includes a Master Joystick Mod-
ule, you can set a defa ult state for their assignments in the Tracks Local Options screen. 
7In the lower Strips Scroller, tap to desel ect the strip blocks for any strips you do no t want stored in and recalled with the L ayout. 
•T a p  All to highlight and select all strips. 
•T a p  None  to clear all strip selections, then ta p individual strip bl ocks as desired. You can focus other workstations using the Soft Keys (le tting you leave the touchs creen in Layouts view). For more information,  
see 
If you create or mod ify a Layout but press Recall  before storing it, a new backup Layout ca n be created in the next available block 
in the grid, or the current layout can be updated. For more information, see Saving Changed Layouts to New or Current .
Figure 66. Layouts Store grid



Chapter 23: Layouts 203Strip blocks that are not selected will not be stored and, when the Layout is recalled, the corr esponding strips remain on thei r pre-
viously displayed tracks. For example, in Fi gure 67 strips 1–4 are selected while strips  5–8 are not. Tracks have been placed on  
strips 1, 2, and 3, but not on strip 4. When this Layout is reca lled, strips 1–3 will show thei r assigned tracks,  strip 4 will be blank, 
and strips 5–8 will continue to  display tracks from the previously recalled Layout (if any). 
8Tap a block in the Store grid. The block hi ghlights and is auto matically num bered, and Store  appears at the far right of the Lay-
outs Commands across the bottom of the screen. The Layout  Name field also appears with a flashing cursor. 
9Do either of the following: 
• To store the Layout with only its assigned number for its name, tap Store . 
• To enter a custom name for the Layout tap the Layout Name  field, enter a name using the on-screen keyboard, then tap Enter .
10Repeat to create a dditional Layouts. 
To exit Layout Mode: 
Press Shift + Layout Mode . The system returns to Banking mode and disp lays tracks from the currently focused DAW. 
Once Layouts are stored, they can be recalled from the touchscreen or the Soft Keys (see Recalling Layouts ). Figure 67. Four strips selected to be stored; three with tracks and one blank. 
You can use Spill Zones to keep strips outsi de the zone in Banking mode  (all tracks in the session)  available while accessing t racks 
stored in the Layout. For more information, see Chapter 25, “Spill Zones.”

Creating New Layouts Based on Currently Banked Tracks
You can create Layouts consisting of all or all selected tracks currently banked to the surface. This is useful for quickly sav ing the 
current state of the surface to a layout. For example, if you us e Pro Tools Memory Locations and Windows Configurations to stor e 
and recall shown or hidden tracks, you can re call those Memory Locations and quickly store each arrangement of tracks as a layo ut. 
There are two ways to assign all banked tracks to a layout , and a quick way to add all se lected tracks to a layout. 
Add All Use Double-Tap Assign, or Tracks View Assign
Add Selected Use Tracks Assign
Tracks View Assign
In the Tracks page in Banking mode, you can specify whether you wa nt to add all or all currently selected tracks to the Layout.  
To add all or all selected tracks to a Layout from the Tracks page: 
1Navigate the touchscreen to the Tracks pa ge and make sure you are in Banking mode  (not Layouts mode).  All desired tracks 
must be banked to fader st rips (any off-bank tracks or those in hidden Swap layers are ignored). 
2Press the Assign  switch (along the bottom of the screen). Clear All button
When the Master Module Shift switch is held down, it is normal for the Assign butt on to also change and become Assign Post. 
To include or exclude hidden tr acks, first configure S6 Hidden Tr ack preferences to s how hidden tracks in Banking and in Layout

To create a new layout based on all currently banked tracks: 
1In the Tracks screen Local Options, enable Double Tap Assign to Copy Tracks from Banking Mode into Current Layout .
2Make sure the su rface is in Banki ng mode (the Layout Mode  switch LED should be off). 
3Arrange all desired tracks onto fader stri ps by recalling a memory location, by bankin g or nudging (do not spill to either spil l 
zone: spilled tracks will be ignored).
4In the Tracks screen, double-tap the Assign  button quickly. 
All tracks currently banked onto strips are mapped to strips in the strip scroller, and the system enters Layout Assign mode. 
5If desired, add or remove tr acks, or enable/disable strips using th e Track matrix and lower strip scroller. 
6Press Store . 
7Do either of the following: 
• To create a new layout, tap to sele ct an empty layout block. Enter a cu stom name for the layout if desired. 
• To overwrite an existing layout, tap its layout block in the store grid.
8Press Store  to save the new layout. 
Surface Command to Add (or Remove) Track to Layout 
You can add tracks to a layout by assigning the Add to Layout  command using Channel Strip Keys . 
Enable this channel key (it lights  orange) to include one or more tracks in the current layout the next time you enter Layout A ssign 
mode. A track can be added to the active la yout from a Spill Left, Spill Right, or Spil l Zone. Tracks are a dded to Layout strip s in 
their current banking position. 
You can also use this command to remo ve a track from the current layout. 
Add to Layout  is not available when the surface is in  Layout mode. If the layout is banked too far to the left for the assignment to 
be in the layout, the tr ack will not be added. Figure 70. Layout Assign commands in Tracks screen

Chapter 23: Layouts 207Recalling Layouts 
Layouts can be recalled from the touchscreen or from the Soft  Keys. Track Layouts can be sp illed into spill zones (see Spilling Se-
lected Tracks to a Zone ). Track Layouts store and recall the knob function (s uch as EQ, Dyn, or Sends) assigned when the Layout 
was stored (you can configure S6 to ignore stored functions if de sired). Post Layouts can only be  spilled to Mast er Post Module s. 
Meter Layouts only affect Ma ster Meter Modules, but can be  linked to Track Layouts. 
Tracks are stored in a Layout using a unique track ID (UID) to ensure tracks appear on the corre ct strips. If a Layout is recal led but 
S4/S6 cannot match the track UID it  will search for a matching track name, or (a bsolute) track number, and then by workstation.  
By storing and matching track ID, name and/or  number, and workstation you can create La youts in session templates that will per -
sist in new sessions. 
For maximum session and project compatibility, a new preference in Settings > System  lets you enable “leg acy” track matching 
as available in 2021.10 and earlier. When the Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching  setting is enabled, track matching will use 
UID, track name, or (absolute) track number only. This setting is disabled by default. 
Recalling Layouts from the Touchscreen
To recall a Layout from the touchscreen:
1Navigate to the Tracks screen. 
2Do either of the following: 
• To recall a Track Layout, tap Recall . 
• To recall a Post Layout, hold the Master Module Shift  switch (the on-screen Assign  switch becomes Assign Post ) and tap 
Assign Post , then tap Recall . 
3In the Layout Recall  grid, tap to recall the de sired Layout. The surface up dates to match the Layout. 
4Tap Done  to close the Layout Recall grid. 
Recalling Layouts from Soft Keys
Track Layouts and Post Layouts can be recall ed from the Master Module Soft Key banks. This lets you recall  Layouts without hav-
ing to leave the current view on the Touchscreen. Post La youts can also be recalled from the MPM Soft Keys bank. 
To recall Track Layouts from the Master Module Soft Keys: 
1Create and store, or load Layouts into S6 (see Saving and Loading La yout Sets (Titles) ). 
2Press Layout Mode  on the Master Module. The Soft Keys on the Master Module display the currently available Track Layouts. See also Recall Layout Banking  for information about optimizing how bank ing responds when recalling Layouts.

Chapter 24: Swap Layers 213Chapter 24: Swap Layers
S4 and S6 let you assign tracks to up to four Swap layers, le tting you quickly access different tracks from the same Fader Modu le 
strip(s). Tracks are assigned to Swap layers from the Layouts Assign  page (Swap layers are only av ailable in Layouts mode). You 
can then cycle all strips through each Swap layer from the Master  Module (S4 and S6). On S6, you can also initiate Swap from fa der 
strips to cycle all strips or individual st rips. To simplify navigation, the names of tracks in othe r Swap layers can be shown on Dis-
play Modules. 
To assign tracks to Swap layers: 
1Go to Tracks > Local Options  (gear icon).

Chapter 24: Swap Layers 2146Assign tracks to the Layout. As tracks are added, their current Swap layer assignment is shown in  the lower strip scroller in t he 
strip displays on Fader Modules , and in strips on Display Modules. By defaul t, strips are assigned to Swap layer A. 
7To assign strips to other la yers, press the Master Module Swap  switch to cycle through layers  B, C, and D and assign tracks 
to each layer as desired. 
8Press Store  to name and store the new layout. 
9Make sure to exit Lay out Assign mode (tap Assign  so it becomes unlit). 
To navigate fader strips to different layers: 
1Recall a layout with assignments to mult iple layers. On S6 (only) the strip Swap  switches light to indica te additional tracks are 
available on othe r Swap layers. 
2To cycle all strips through layers (global swap) press the blue Swap  switch to the left of the touchscreen on the Master Module. 
Or on S6 (only) press the Master Module All switch so it is lit and then press any lit strip Swap  switch. ( All is latching and re-
mains active until you press it  again so it becomes unlit.) 
3S6 only: To navigate individual strips through Swap layers, press any lit strip Swap  switch. If different strips are on different 
layers, pressing master Swap  uses the currently attentioned track as the starting layer for cycling. 
Settings for Swap Layers

Chapter 24: Swap Layers 215Here are a few example images of  Swap indication on CDMs. 
Insert/Delete Assign Modes Affect All Swap Layers
When enabled, inserting or de leting a track from a Swap layer inserts or  deletes that slot in all Swap layers. 
Swap Assignments in Titles and Sessions
Swap assignments are stored within their pa rent Layout(s), in Titles, and in session files. All assignment s persist regardless of the 
Number of Layout Swap Layers  setting. For example, assigning tracks to all 4 Sw ap layers and then lowe ring the setting to 2 lay-
ers does not lose the assignments to layers  3 and 4. Similarly, transferring a Title or  session to a different system preserves  all Swap 
assignments, even if there are fewer Swap  layers defined on the opening system. 
Swap and Spill
Swap layers are not available on tracks sp illed using VCA, Track Type, Workstation, or Folder Spill. Swap la yers remain availab le 
on tracks/strips outside of the spill z one. Swap also remains available when a Layout is spilled to a spill zone. 
Flip
Pressing global or strip Swap  (S6 only) exits Flip mode, if enabled. Examples of Swap layer indication on CDM 4 Swap layers: layer A active,

Chapter 25: Spill Zones 216Chapter 25: Spill Zones
Spill Zones let you designate area s of the surface to spill VCAs, Layouts, tracks by type, and tracks by workstation. Up to two  
non-overlapping spill zones can be defined. Spill zones provide access to session elements in consiste nt locations,  and leave s trips 
outside the zone unaffe cted and available. Expand  Knob Zones and Fader Zone s provide similar capabili ties for attention track 
functions, with the additional capabi lity to map parameters to faders. 
QuickStart for Using Spill Zones
You can spill VCAs, Layouts, trac ks, and workstations to spill zones by doing the following:
• Define up to two spill zones in Settings > Surface  (see Configuring Spill Zones ). 
• VCAs can be spilled to a spill zone, or to  as many adjacent strips as  needed (standard VCA spill), directly from the Fader Mod -
ule/CSM strip for the VCA master using its Menu  switch (see VCA Spill ). You can also configure VC As to spill automatically 
to zones or to adjacent strips when the VCA is attentioned (see Auto Select Joystick Stri ps when Storing Layouts ).
• Layouts, tracks, and workstations can be spilled to zones by first enabling the L Spill  or R Spill  switches on the Master Module, 
enabling the Layout Mode , Type , or WS switches, then selectin g the desired element to spill from the Soft Keys. 
• Once an element is spilled to a zone, the L Spill  and R Spill  switch LEDs light in colors matching the element that is spilled. Spill 
can be indicated on strips by lit Menu  switches in corresponding colors , and you can also set the strip Menu  switches to unspill 
(see Options for Spill ). Master Module switches for Spill Zones: 1) WS, 2) Layout Mode,  3) Type, 4) L and R Spill, 5) Nudge and Bank, and 6) Shift

Chapter 25: Spill Zones 217• Pressing an enabled Spill switch so it  is lit white lets you use the Bank ( << and >>) and Nudge ( < and >) switches to bank and 
nudge tracks within the select ed spill zone, without affec ting tracks outside the zone. 
Options for Spill
Several Preference settings let you customize th e following aspects of spill zone operation. 
• Choose how you want spilled elements to be justified within zones (see Bank and Spill Zone Justification Settings ). 
• Choose whether or not to have spill zone Menu  switch LEDs light, and whet her they let you unspill (see Spill Zone Menu Key 
Mode for Layouts, Workstations or Types ). 
• Customize how many Master Module Soft Key banks are used for spill selection (see System Soft Key Display Mode ). 
• Choose whether or not Soft Keys automatically return to their previous view after selecting an element to spill (see Auto Close 
Surface Recall Soft Keys ).
• Choose whether recalling a Layout  automatically collapses the currently enabled Spill Zone(s) (see Auto-Collapse Spill Zones 
with Layout Recall ). 
Configuring Spill Zones
This section explains how to define spill zones on the surface.  Zone assignments are automatical ly saved on the Master Module.
To configure Spill Zone parameters: 
1Go to Settings > Surface , then touch Config  (or press its Main Menu switch). 
Buttons for Surface, Expand, L Spill, and R Spill appear below the Diagnostics Info  display. 
2Do either of the following:
• To define the left spill zone, touch L Spill . 
• To define the right spill zone, touch R Spill . 
The console dims, and the touchscreen displays th e current surface configuration. Commands for Undo , Done , Clear , and 
Cancel  appear along the bottom of th e screen. Help text is shown in the Info area . If a previous zone was defined, the Attention 
keys are lit on all strips in the existing zone. 
3Press any track Attention  key to assign the beginni ng strip of the spill zone. 
4Press another Attention  key to assign the end of the zone. 
A purple bar appears belo w all strips between, and including, th e selected beginning and end strips. Check out the Avid Pro Tools | S6 Workflows  on YouTube for in-depth explorations of  how to use S6, including Layouts, Spill 
Zones, Expand Zones, and more. Check back frequently for updates to this ongoing series.

Chapter 25: Spill Zones 2185Do any of the following:
• Touch Undo  if you press the wrong Attention key. 
• Touch Clear  to remove the spill zone. 
• Touch Cancel  to exit the spill zone configuration screen without  changing the current spill zone definition (if any). 
6Touch Done  to accept the spill zone. 
7Repeat for the other zone, if desired. 
Spilling Layouts, Tracks, and Workstations
The following sections provide step-by-step instructions for spilling Layouts, tracks, and workstations to spill zones. 
Spilling Layouts to a spill zone differs fro m simply recalling a Layout as follows: 
• When a Layout is spilled  to a zone, strips outside the zone are unaffect ed and remain on their currently banked tracks. 
• When a Layout is recalled , the surface enters Layout mode in which only trac ks that are in a Layout can appear on the surface. 
Strips that are not included in the Layout  will be blank, or continue to show trac ks from the previously recalled Layout (depen d-
ing on whether their strips were scoped fo r recall when the Layout was created). 
Tracks can be spilled by type (such as Audi o, Aux, Instrument, or Masters) into spil l zones, or across as many strips as needed . 
Tracks from other workstations  can be spilled to zones, without having to  focus the parent workstation/application. 
To spill a layout, track type or workstation to a spill zone: 
1On the Master Module, press to enable L Spill  or R Spill .
2Press one of the following swit ches on the Master Module: 
• For Layouts, press Layout Mode .
• For Track types, press Type . (To spill a Track Type across as many strips as needed, disable L or R Spill and press Type .)
• For workstations, press WS. 
The Master Module soft keys display av ailable choices for the enabled element (L ayouts, track types, or workstations). 
3Press a soft key to select  and spill the corresponding Layout, Track type, or workstation to the enabled spill zone (left or ri ght). 
• When a layout is spilled the Layout Mode  switch LED lights dark blue. The enabled L Spill  or R Spill  switch on the Master 
Module also lights dark blue. 
• When any track type (other than All) is spilled, the enabled L Spill  or R Spill switch on the Master Module is pink. 
• When a workstation is spilled, the enabled L Spill  or R Spill switch on the Master Module is light blue (the same color as 
when tracks are spilled).
On channel strips, Menu  switches within the enabled zone light in the same color as the enabled L Spill  or R Spill  switch if the 
option to light them is enabled (see Spill Zone Menu Key Mode for Layouts, Workstations or Types ). 
4To bank or nudge tracks within a sp ill zone, make sure the corresponding L Spill  or R Spill  switch is lit white (press if neces-
sary), then use the Bank and Nudge  switches on the Master Module. 
5To unspill, press Shift  + L Spill  or R Spill  on the Master Module, or press Menu  on any strip in the spill zone when the Menu  
keys are configured to unspill (see Spill Zone Menu Key Mode for Layouts, Workstations or Types ).For information on spilling VCAs to sp ill zones (or to adja cent strips), see VCA Spill . 
You can also spill selected tracks to ei ther zone while in Layout mode (see Spilling Selected Tracks to a Zone ).
Spill Zone banking commands are al so available as Soft Ke ys in the default Pro Tools assignm ents (along with other Surface com-
mands). You can navi gate spill zones by Banking from the Fader Module or CSM . 
Commands to collapse (unspill) the left and right spill zones are also av ailable as Soft Keys. 


Chapter 26: Expand 219Chapter 26: Expand
S4/S6 provides two ways to expand (or “spill”) plug-i n and function para meters to controls  on the surface, Strip Expand  and At-
tention Expand Zones . 
Strip Expand   Spills parameters beyond the current strip, expanding (or “spilling”) EQ, dynamics, or  other functions across mul-
tiple controls on Knob, Process, and/or Fader modules in the same chassis as the track (S6), or across the track’s CSM (S4). 
Attention Expand Zones   Spill parameters for the Attention Track to designated Attention Expand modules  to provide expanded 
control for Attention Track parame ters in a consistent location. On S6, up to two Knob Modules and one Fa der Module can be des-
ignated as Attention Expand Zones.  S4 supports up to two optional Knob Modules as Attention Expand Zones. 
Attention Expand Zones follow Home screen focus, and can be configured for primary and fallback function views. 
• When a plug-in or function is expanded to  an Attention Expand Knob Z one, the arrangement of parame ters to knobs is pre-de-
termined, and consistent. You can substitute other para meters temporarily, but subs titutions do not persist. 
• When a plug-in or function is e xpanded to an Attention Expand Fader Zone, the arrangement of parameters to faders is de-
termined by your own custom mapping (you must first create cust om maps of parameters to fa ders, as explained in the fol-
lowing sections). 
• Attention Expand Knob Z ones and Attention Expand Fader Zones can be togg led on and off independently to maximize pa-
rameter access and visibility. 
Check out the Avid Pro Tools | S6 Workflows  on YouTube for in-depth explorations of how to use S4/S6 , including Layouts, 
Spill Zones, Expand Zone s, and more. Check back fr equently for updates to this ongoing series. 
To see how EQ and Dynamics parameter s map to knobs in either Strip Expand or Attention Expand mode, see Appendix B, “EQ 
and DYN Parameters in Expand Mode.”


Chapter 26: Expand 220Strip Expand 
Strip Expand mode spills paramete rs beyond the current strip, expanding (or “sp illing”) EQ, dynamics, or other functions across  
multiple controls on Knob, Process, an d/or Fader modules in the same chassis as the track (S6) or the CSM (S4). 
• When a plug-in or fu nction is expanded to Expand Knobs , the arrangement of parameters to knobs is consistent and cannot be 
changed. To see examples of where EQ and Dyn parameters are mapped, see EQ and DYN Parameters in Expand Mode . 
• When a plug-in or function is expanded to Expand Faders , the arrangement of parameters to faders is determined by your own 
custom mapping. You must first create or load cust om maps as explained in  the following sections. 
Indication of Expand Mode on Display Modules  Whenever any track is in a strip Expa nd mode, an orange outline appears 
around the track name of the expanded track on its Display Module strip. When Expand mode is enab led on more than one strip, 
the outline appears around the most  recently expa nded strip name. 
If the Display Module is in any Function vi ew, the knobs are also outlined in orange. When Display Modules are set to display t wo 
functions, both sets of knob functions are outlined. In additio n, Display Modules in any Function view show EQ or Dynamics 
graphs, or Pan, as follows: 
• When EQ is expanded, the EQ graph appears on strip 3 (replacing the inpu t and output Function display). 
• When Dyn is expanded, the dyna mics graph appears on strip 8. 
• When Pan is expanded, pa n appears on strip 8. 
Expand Knobs
You can configure Expand Knobs to  automatically follow selection of one or more functions (see Auto Expand Functions ) or you 
can enable Expand Knobs manually as de scribed in the following instructions. 
To enable Knob Expand mode on a strip: 
1Press Exp on the Process Module (S6) or CSM (S4). 
Multiple strips can be in E xpand mode simultaneously.
The most recently selected S6 stri p/function, or S4 Focus strip/functi on, is expanded. Selecting a different 
function for an Expanded strip replaces  the currently expand ed function view.
When enabled, the Exp switch LED lights orange. Only the currently expa nded function LED is lit on the Process Module or 
CSM, letting you quickly iden tify what is being viewed. Figure 75. Indication of Expand mode on a Display Module (track 7) 
To put all strips into strip Exp and mode simultaneously, press the All switch (on the Master Module) before 
pressing Expand. The All switch is latching, so press it again to disable All mode (the switc h becomes unlit). 
Figure 76. EQ expanded to a Knob Module



Chapter 26: Expand 221• If multiple strips are in  Expand mode the inactive Expand keys light yellow. 
• When enabled in an S6 chassis with one or more Knob Module s, Expand mode take s over either or both Knob Modules de-
pending on the number and mapping of parameters in the current function. 
• When enabled on a strip in an S6 chassis with only one Fa der Module and one Process module  (no Knob Modules), Expand 
mode takes over the eight knobs of the Process Module. 
2If more parameters are available than there are controls, the < and > (Page) switches light on strip 8; press either to navigate to 
other parameters.
3To take a strip out of Expand mode, press its lit Exp switch. 
Expand Faders 
Expand Faders let you map parameters  from plug-ins and other function s to faders on Fader Modules. 
• Parameters from each plug-in or function ca n be mapped to faders in any order. When  secondary parameters exist they appear 
by default on the strip Mute  and/or Select  switches. Multiple maps ca n be created to store and re call assignments for each 
plug-in (such as one map for EQ3, another ma p for Dyn3, and so on) and function (one for pan, another for sends, and so on). 
• Once maps have been created they can be recalled onto any Fade r Module by enabling Fader Expand  mode in any resident strip, 
similar to standard Knob Module Expand. You can also configure Fader Zones to automatically expand when there is a valid map 
for the selected pl ug-in or function. 
Creating Expand Fader Maps
You can assign parameters from knobs to faders to create custom parameter maps. You ca n define one custom map per 
plug-in/function per session. For example, a single session can include a custom ma p for the Dyn3 Compressor/Limiter plug-in, 
and a map for BF-76. Each map can include parameters from a singl e plug-in or function. You must create at least one parameter 
map in order to utilize Attention Expand Fader Zones. 
Variants of the same plug-in or function (such as 1-band and 7-band EQ3) share a si ngle map. Different fo rmats/channel widths 
(such as mono versus stereo) vary depending on the type of processing and manufacturer. 
• EQ or Dynamics plug-ins can sometimes share a si ngle map between mono, ster eo, and other formats. 
• Plug-ins from other categories (suc h as Delay) often require unique  maps for each variant or width, but this varies with diffe rent 
plug-ins from different manufacturers. 
Custom fader maps are stored in User Preferences (use Autoload from Titles and Sessions  to manage fader maps). 
Custom Faders maps are created using the same ba sic technique as Custom Knobs. To learn how, see Custom Knobs and Cus-
tom Faders . Figure 77. EQ parameters mapped to faders in Expand Fader mode



Chapter 26: Expand 222Recalling an Expand Fader Map
Once maps have been created they can be recalled onto any Fader Module by enabling Fader Expand mode from any resident strip. 
You can also configure Fader Zones to automa tically expand when there is a valid map fo r the selected plug-in or function (see 
Auto Expand Faders ). 
To access a stored map: 
1If the Exp switch on the desired strip is lit bl ue (solid, not flashing), select a Function that ha s previously been mapped. 
2If the Exp switch on the desired strip is no t lit, do either of the following: 
• Hold down the Exp switch on the desired strip for at least half a second. Any previously stored map is recalled. 
• Press Attention  + Exp on the desired strip. Any stor ed map is recalled, and the Exp switch flashes, indi cating map edit mode. 
3To exit, press the lit Exp switch so it becomes unlit. 
Expand Fader Maps 9–16 Banking
The User 1  and User 2  switches bank between pages while a ssigning parameters to faders or when a fader map is recalled on a

faders). 
The modifier switches Shift, Ctrl, Opt/Win, and Cmd/Alt  remain available on the Fader Module or CSM when in Expand mode. 
Auto Expand Faders
Enabling the Auto Expand Faders  setting lets you expand mapp ed parameters to faders wi th a single press of the Exp switch. 
When not enabled, expanding parameters to fade rs requires you to hold down the Exp switch, or press Attention  + Exp. 
To configure Expand Fader to auto expand:

Chapter 26: Expand 223Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching
The Auto-Load preference Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching is available in Settings > System . 
Tracks are stored in a Layout using a unique track ID (UID) to ensure tracks appear on the corre ct strips. If a Layout is recal led but 
S4/S6 cannot match the track UID it  will search for a matching track name, or (a bsolute) track number, and then by workstation.  
By storing and matching track ID, name and/or  number, and workstation you can create La youts in session templates that will per -
sist in new sessions. 
For maximum session and project co mpatibility, this preference in Settings > System  lets you enable “legacy” track matching as 
available in 2021.10 a nd earlier. When the Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching  setting is enabled, track matching will use UID, 
track name, or (absolute) track number on ly. This setting is disabled by default. 
This setting is availabl e as a Surface Soft Key. 
Saving and Transferring Expand Fader Maps
(Save, Load, Auto Load, and Transfer)
Expand Fader maps are stored in User Preferences along with most  S6 settings and attributes, in cluding User Se ttings, Layouts, and 
Spill Zone states. 
You can manually save User  Preference files from the Settings > User  page using the Save  and Save As  commands. These com-
mands let you name the file and choose a loca tion on the Master Module. To archive or transfer your settings and fader maps, go  
to Settings > About , press Logout , then in the File Explorer naviga te to your saved file and transfer  it via USB or to an available 
network destination. 
You can also have User Preferences, custom fader maps and other settings stored in se ssions, and configure S6 to automatically 
load some or all attributes from that session or project. To utilize session storage and automa tic loading, first designate a w orksta-
tion and application, then configure Auto Load settings in Settings > System . 
• Designating a workstation and application tells S6 to store sett ings and attributes into session s or projects on that workstat ion 
and application. 
• Auto Load settings tell S6 which attributes  to load from those sessions or projects. 
Store attributes in session/project templates (if your applicatio n supports them) to be able to  access custom fader maps, Layou ts, 
and other attributes in future work. Auto-Load preference to Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching, in Settings > System



Chapter 26: Expand 224Attention Expand Zones
On S6, up to two Knob Modules and on e Fader Module can be designated as Attention Expand Zones. On S4, up to two Knob Mod-
ule can be designated as an Attention Expand Zone. 
Attention Expand Zones provide expanded cont rol for Attention Track parameters in a de signated, consistent location. Attention 
Expand Zones follow Home screen focu s, and can be configured for prim ary and fallback function views. 
• When a plug-in or function is expanded to an Attention Expand Knob Zone , the arrangement of parameters to knobs is pre-de-
termined, and consistent. You can substitute other parameters temporarily, but substituti ons do not persist.  M40 systems sup-
port up to two Knob Modules as Expand Zone s (M10 systems support one Expand zone). 
• When a plug-in or functi on is expanded to an Attention Expand Fader Zone , the arrangement of parame ters to faders is de-
termined by your own custom mapping (you must first create  custom maps of parameters to faders, as explained in Creating 
Expand Fader Maps
• Attention Expand Knob Zone s and Attention Expand Fader Zones can be toggled on (enabled) and off (disabled) 
independently to maximize para meter access and visibility. 
Configuring Modules as Attention Expand Zones

Chapter 27: User Preferences 239Show Hidden Tracks In
These Preferences let you choose whether or  not hidden tracks are shown in Banking, Layout, or VCA modes. When configured 
to be shown, hidden track names are dimmed on the t ouchscreen, on Fader Modules, and on Display Modules. 
To configure hidden track display: 
1Go to Settings > Preferences. 
2In the Strips section, enable th e following settings as desired: 
Banking Mode When enabled, hidden tracks are visible in Banking mode and can be assigned to Lay outs (default is disabled). 
Layout Mode When enabled, hidden tracks stored in Layouts are visi ble when the layout is recalled (default is enabled). 
VCA Spill When enabled, hidden tracks are visible when their master VCA is spilled (default is enabled). 
When enabled to be shown in Banking mode, hi dden tracks on the Tracks and Home scre ens have dimmed track names in the Track 
matrix, Meter scroller and Function scroller. Track Numbers (if enabled) are hidden. On Fader Modules, strip displays are dimme d. 
When hidden tracks are shown, they are indicated on Display Modules and distinguishable from muted tracks as follows: 
• If a track is active, shown, and unmuted,  it appears fully lit (“1” in Figure 88). 
• If the track is hidden but unmuted, trac k name (only) is dimmed, and no trac k number is shown (“2” in Figure 88). 
• If the track is hidden and muted, the entire strip is d immed, and no track number is shown (“3” in Figure 88).

templates that have many ac tive and/or inactive tracks. 
To exclude or include inactive tracks: 
1Go to Settings > User  and navigate to the Strips  section. 
2Click to toggle Exclude Inactive Tracks . 
Use Pro Tools Track Record Mode Colors
• When enabled, this setting sets all S6 indicators to follow Pro Tools track Record mode indication. For example, when Pro 
Tools is in TrackPunch or DestructivePun ch mode and tracks are enabled for punch recording, indicators flash blue and red. 
• When not enabled, record indica tors light (or flash) red only. 
Auto-Collapse Spill Zones with Layout Recall
When enabled, recalling a Layout automatically collapses the currently enabled Spill Zone(s). 
Make sure neither Sp ill Zone is selected (make sure neither L Spill  or R Spill  are lit white). If necessary, press LS p i l l  and/or R 
Spill  so that their switch LEDs light in the co lor corresponding to what is spilled (dark green for VCAs, light blue for Track Types , 
or dark blue for Layouts).

Chapter 27: User Preferences 241Auto Expand Functions
This setting lets you designate functions to  automatically expand when they are selected . In use, enabling this setting saves y ou a 
step of first enabling Exp (Expand) on a strip before selecting a function. 
To use Auto Expand Functions: 
1Go to the Settings > User  page, and scroll down to the Strips  section. 
2In the Auto Expand Functions  section, tap to select each function you want to configure for auto expand. 
Not all functions apply to all DAWs. For example, HEAT  only applies to Pro Tools, and Quick Controls  to Cubase and Nuendo. 
3Bank the desired track to a strip on the surface. 
Make sure the strip is not below either Kn ob Module designated as an Expand Zone. 
4On a Process Module or CSM, press a Function switch for a fu nction you enabled to Auto E xpand in the previous step. 
In that strip on the Process Module or CSM, the Exp switch lights. On the corresponding  Knob Module(s), parameters for the 
selected function occupy as  many encoders as required. 
5To expand a different function on that strip, press the swit ch for the desired function. 
6To exit, press the lit Exp switch on a strip or do the following: 
• To collapse all currently expanded functions, press the Master Module All switch and then press any lit Exp switch. 
• Press a Function switch fo r any function that is not enabled for Auto Expand. 
Auto Expand Inserts Selection
The Inserts Selection  option was recently added to the choi ces for Auto Expand. Enable this se tting to have any insert Auto Ex-
pand when selected from the top level knob set on S6  Knob Modules or from the S4 upper Knob section. 
With the ability to trigger Auto Expand from Inserts Selection  you have more flexibility for wh en Expand mode is automatically 
enabled. For example, by leaving the Auto Expand > EQ  setting off you can use the EQ switch to list a track’s EQ plug-ins without 
immediately entering Expa nd mode for the first, last edit ed, or designated cycle slot. With Inserts Selection enabled , you can then 
directly expand the EQ plug-in you want. By comparison, when only Auto Expand > Inserts  is enabled pressing the Ins switch 
causes other strips to darken. 
Auto Expand Faders
Enabling the Auto Expand Faders  setting lets you Expand  mapped parameters to faders wi th a single pre ss of the strip Exp 
switch. When not enabled, expanding paramete rs to faders requires you to hold down the Exp switch, or press Attention  + Exp. 
Assign Right Joystick Timeout
The Assign Right Joystick Timeout  setting determines the time window within which attentioning an additional track assigns that 
track to the right joystick, let ting you optimize how tracks can be assigned to  the different joysticks on Master Joystick Modu les. Auto Expand Function section in Settings > User
Settings > User, Joysti ck Strips section



Chapter 27: User Preferences 242You can specify the time range for joystick assignment to between 0 and 3 seconds in Set tings > User . 
• A setting of 0/Off means the right j oystick will not be assigned to a diff erent track than the left joystick. 
• Any setting of 0.25 seconds or higher sp ecifies the time window in which attentioni ng an additional track assigns that track 
to the right joystick. 
Layouts
Ignore Functions on Layout Recall
By default, Layouts store an d recall the current assignment of functions. You can defeat this behavior so functions are not cha nged 
when recalling Layo uts by enabling the Ignore Functions on Layout Recall  setting . 
• When disabled (the defa ult setting), recalling a Layout re assigns controls to the function s assigned while the Layout was 
saved. 
• When enabled, recalling a Layout leaves the surface on its current function assignme nts and ignores any stored in the Layout.
Recall Layout Banking
(Layout Banked Position on Recall Mode)
The Layout Banked Position on Recall Mode  setting controls if and how banking is stored and recalled along with Layouts. 
Each available setting is described in the table, below. 
•Layout Banking Position  is the banking offset that is saved with each Layout. 
•Surface Banking Position  is where the surface is currently banked at the moment. Figure 89. Layouts in Settings > User
Options for Layout Banked Position on Recall Mode

out any merge changes.
Update Global Banked Position to 
Stored PositionSurface banking position is updated to the stored Lay out banking value. Layout is recalled without 
any merge changes.
Merge Layout at Stored PositionSurface banking position is not changed. Layout is  recalled to the banking position stored and 
merged with the existing surface tracks. This can l eave the existing tracks visible to the left or right 
of the recalled layout tracks.
Update Global Position for Full 
Layouts, Merge for PartialIf the Layout being recalled fills the entire set of  strips available and has no holes, the surface bank-
ing position is updated to the stored Layout banki ng value and the Layout tracks are recalled. If the 
Layout does not fill the entire set of strips available or  has holes in the set of strips stored in the Lay-
out, the surface banking position is not changed, the Layout is recalled to the banking position 
stored, and merged with the existing surface tracks. This can leave the existi ng tracks visible to the 
left or right of the recalled Layout tracks, just like the "Merge Layout at Stored Position" option. 



Chapter 27: User Preferences 243Auto Save Changed Layout on Recall Mode
This setting lets you optimize how Layouts  are managed. If you create or modify a Layo ut but press Recall be fore storing it as a 
new Layout, a backup Layout can be created in the next available block in the grid, or the current layout can be updated. You c an 
specify whether to save the new track arrang ement to a new layout or to the currently loaded layout using the selector in the L ayouts 
section of Settings > User.  
To configure Layouts Auto-Save settings: 
1In Settings > Preferences , scroll to the Layouts  section. 
2Tap the selector for Auto-Save Changed Layout on Recall Mode:  and choose one of the following: 
Off  When enabled, no backup Layouts are created. 
Save to New Layout Slot When enabled, backup Layouts are created in the next  available block in the grid. Backup Layouts will 
be automatically named and numbered, such as “Backup_01.” If there are no tracks assigned, no backup will be created.
Save to Current Layout Slot When enabled, the current (l ast recalled) layout is updated (no backup is created). 
Knobs
Settings in the Knobs section let you control how functions and parameters are displayed across Knob Modules, and set how pa-
rameter values respond to knob rotation.
Send/Insert/Input/Bus Knobs Reversed
The Sends/Inserts Knobs Reversed preference lets you configure Knob Modules to disp lay sends and inserts, input source, and bus  
(output) destinations in either  of two ways, “a–j” or “j–a.”
• When enabled, function choice s are displayed from the bottom knob, up (slot “ a” appears on the knob closest to the operator, 
“b” above it, and so on). Th is is the default setting. 
• When disabled, function choices are disp layed from the top knob, down (slot “a” a ppears on the knob furthest from the oper-
ator, with “b” below it, and so on). Figure 90. Knobs section in Settings > User



Chapter 27: User Preferences 244Reverse Function Pages for 5-Knob Strips
This setting lets you configure Knob Module function views to di splay parameters in either their default order, or “reversed” f rom 
their factory mapping. When enabled, EQ plug -in parameters start with low frequency pa rameters instead of high (or the opposite , 
depending on the defa ult mapping of that plug-in). 
Remember Joystick Knobs by Track
This setting determines whether or not  pan parameter assignments persist on  Master Joystick Module encoders. 
• When enabled, the assignment of pan para meters to Master Joystick Module knobs is maintained for each track when 
attentioned. 
• When not enabled, attentioning a new track to either joystick inherits the knob assi gnments of the previously attentioned trac k. 
Knob Speed and Sensitivity
These settings let you optimize knob respon se. Two pairs of controls are available (M aximum Speed, and Sensitivity) to configur e 
response settings for function k nobs and, separately, for pan knobs. 
•Knob Maximum Speed and Knob Sensitivity  configure the response for all function knobs other than pan. 
•Pan Knob Maximum Speed and Pan Knob Sensitivity  configure the response for knobs controlling pan, only. 
Rotating any knob slowly adjusts parameters at the finest resolution available from the function/paramet er. The following setti ngs 
determine response when knobs are tw isted quickly. Recommended (default) sett ings are shown above each slider. 
Maximum Speed  Determines the range of a knob relative to the minimum to maximum values of the current parameter. At its 
lowest setting (10), rotating a knob quickly requires approximat ely two complete rotations to go from minimum to maximum. At 
its highest setting (100), parameters go from minimum to maximum value with a single rotation of the knob. 
Sensitivity Determines how a knob reaches the current Max Speed setting.  When set to its maximum setting (100), rotating a knob 
slowly adjust parameters at the finest resolution available, an d rotating quickly adjusts paramete rs as determined by the curre nt 
Max Speed setting. At its lowest setting (0), response speed is roughly relative to rotation speed, achieving Max Speed only wh en 
turned very quickly. 
Examples
For “fine” control (a 1:1 relationship between knob rotati on and parameter increments), rotate the knob slowly. 
To be able to cover an entire parameter range with one rotation of a knob, set Max Sp eed to its maximum setting (100). For ex-
ample, set Max Speed to its highest  setting to be able to sweep an EQ filter fr om lowest to highest frequencies with one twist.
To further optimize knob response, adjust Sensitivity to set th e knob speed required to achieve the current maximum speed. 
Number of Knobs per Plug-in or In strument Transmitted over EUCON
This setting helps optimize S6 performance  for plug-ins with extremely large numbers of parameters. Availa ble settings range fr om 
100/minimum to 2000, or Unlimited /maximum, with a default setting of 1000 . Settings lower than Unlimited do not affect DAW 
performance or automation in any way, they on ly limit the amount of data being sent or received across EUCON. Limiting the 
amount of data can improve performance. 
Pro-Load All Knobs on Sess ion Open (Speeds All Mode)
This setting provides an additional way to bala nce system response with  session load times. 
• When enabled, S6 loads all para meters over EUCON when the session or project  is first opened. This makes session naviga-
tion immediately faster, es pecially if you use the All mode frequently, but sessions and pr ojects can take longer to initially 
open and load. 
• When not enabled, S6 loads knob pa rameters as determined by the Number of Knobs per Plug-In or Instrument Transmitted 
Over EUCON setting. Because Knob and Pan Knob Speed and Sensitivity  settings are stored in Us er Preferences your  current settings will be overwrit-
ten when you open a previously saved session or Title and the Autoload from Titles and Sessions  setting for User Prefer-
ences  is enabled in Settings > System . If this occurs, reset the Speed  and Sensitivity sliders to your  preferred settings and then 
resave the session and/or Title.

Tip for Managing Pro Tools Windows
If you want certain plug-in, output /pan, or sends windows to remain  visible at all times, use the Target  feature in Pro Tools. For win-
dows such as essential metering plug-ins, turn the Target off to  ensure it remains vi sible. Click on the Ta rget to toggle it on /off, or 
hold Shift on the computer keyboard while clicking to open a plug-i n window to open it with the Target off. For example, using 
the Control app hold down Shift on the computer keyboard (or the Soft Key for computer Shift) while tapping an Insert. On S3, h old 
down Multi-Select/Shift (or Shift on the computer keyboard. The window opens with the Target off. 
When the Target icon is unlit (gre y), that window remains on-screen unt il you explicitly close that window. 
When the Target icon is lit red in a plug -in, output/pan or send window,  that window is replaced wh en another similar element i s 
attentioned (such as a pl ug-in on a different track). By default, windows open with the Target on.

Chapter 28: System Preferences 252Clear When Session Data Clears
These settings let you select which elements you want cleared from S4/S6 wh en sessions are closed. Choices include Layouts, 
Custom Knob and Fader Maps , and Channel Strip Keys . 
For mo re information on these an d other Auto Load settings, see the S4/S6  Guid e.pdf. 
Remove Unused Session Data on Load
When enabled, loading a Title or open ing a different session clears any unused an d/or temporary system looku p data, reducing 
load times. This should be left on un less you experience lo ad issues.  
Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching
Track s are sto red in a Layo ut using a uniq ue track ID (UID) to ensure tracks appear on the correct strips. If a Layout is recalled but 
S4/S6 cannot match the track  UID it will search for a matching track name, or (absolute) track number, and then by workstation. 
By storin g and matching track  ID, name and /or number, and work station you can create Layouts in session templates that will 
per-sist in new sessions. 
For maximum session and project compatibility, this preference in Settings > System lets y ou enable “legacy” track matching as 
available in 2021.10 and earlier. When the Use Legacy Layout Recall Matching setting is enabled, track matching will use UID, 
track name, or (absolute) track number only. This setting is d isabled by default. 
Designating an Auto-Load Workstation
To designate a workstation for Auto-Load and Store: 
1 Navigate the tou chscreen to  Settings > Workstation, and check the Applications list in th e lower right of the screen. The work-
station must have the blue star indicator.

Chapter 30: Channel Modules 279Fader and Meter
Each strip features a motorized, t ouch-sensitive 100-mm fader with a du al, 30-segment meter to its left.
Track Color / Modifier Key
The Track Color / Modifier key at the botto m of the fader strip lights in the color of its assigned track. The key’s Modifier f unction 
remains fixed on the Fader Module, even wh en tracks (and their colors) ch ange. In fact, they remain active when the strip is em pty.
These keys modify and execute Pro Tools co mmands with defined ke yboard shortcuts (see Pro Tools Commands Using the 
Track Color / Modifier Keys  for a list of commands). 
If there is a dialog window ope n on the Pro Tools DAW, the OK and Cancel  switches on the Fader Modules flash. When the dialog 
is on the currently focused workstation they  flash green; when on a workstation that is not focused, the switches flash orange.  Press 
OK to confirm or Cancel  to cancel the dialog. 
When using Expand Faders , the User 1  and User 2  switches bank between E xpand Faders 1–8 and 9–16. 
Process Module
(S6 Only)
The Process Module lets you assign functions  to the Knob Module, toggle them in and out, and control parameters from its knob 
section. The Process Module provides ei ght strips, each with a knob section, function switches, an d other controls. 
The default knob parameter is Pan but you can reassign it to any other parameter. This is especially useful if your configurati on does 
not include a Knob Module.The Attention Track Fade r does not inherit the Modifier attr ibute from its Fader Module track.
See “Editing a Plug-in Using the S6 Process Module” on page 150.

Chapter 30: Channel Modules 285Channel Strip Module
(S4 Only)
Channel Strip Modules (CSMs) provide the fa der strips for S4 systems. Each CSM provi des eight fader strips  with a lower fader 
section and upper knob section, and central function select section. 
CSMs provide the same functionality on S4 as Fader, Process, and Knob Module s on S6. The primary differences are: 
• The CSM provides a single set of Function Select switches for the eight  fader strips (unlike the S6  Process Module which pro-
vides Function switches for each fa der strip). Function Select switch es include EQ, Dyn, Exp, and more. 
• The CSM fader Focus  switch determines the fader strip to wh ich the Function Sele ct switches apply. Focus  is only available 
on the S4 CSM, not on S6 Fader Modules.
Function Switches
The Function switches select the function displayed on the Knobs. They operate similarly to the Func tion switches on S6 Process  
Modules, except that on the CSM they apply to either the currently Focused  strip, or all strips on that module if no strip is focused. Channel Strip Module

At the top of each CSM fader strip is a Focus  switch. When a strip is focused (its Focus  switch is lit) the central Function Select 
section on the same CSM lets you choose a function to display in the Knob section fo r that strip. You can also have the Knob se ction 
display the same functi on for all strips, or Expand  a function to have the entire Knob se ction provide paramete rs for that function 
for the currently focuse d strip. Note that the Focus  switch is associated with the fader st rip, not any track assigned to the strip.

Chapter 30: Channel Modules 287Display Module
The Display Module has a TFT display and mounting bracket. The underside of the Display Module has power and Ethernet con-
nectors.
When configured as standard Di splay Modules, each displays eight tracks. Display Modules can also be conf igured as Master Me-
ter Modules (MMMs). For more informat ion on MMMs, see Using Master Display Meter Modules . If your system includes Mas-
ter Post Modules see Assigning Tracks to MPM Strips . If your system includes Master Po st Display Modules  for PEC/DIR me-
tering, see Using Master Post Display Modules
The following sections descri be standard Display Modules.
Different display Layouts are available, including Large Meters, Large Waveforms, Meters and Waveforms, Meters and Func-
tion, Waveforms and Function, Waveforms and Dual Function, and Waveforms and Dual Function + Route. 
Each display layout shows the track name, input, and automation status at the bottom. For Large Waveforms  and Waveforms and 
Function , a single meter displays the track’s maximum channel level.  When in any Waveform view, automation breakpoint data 
can be shown. Group name and ID are shown while in any functi on view. All other display Layouts  can show 7.1-channel meters. 
Pan display for multichannel  tracks can be optimized in User settings (see Panner Divergence and Position Display Mode ).
Examples of available display Layouts are shown in Figure 11 9 and Figure 120, Figure 121 and Figure 122, and Figure 123. These 
figures may not show certain display el ements that are available in the most recent version of S6 software. See Display Module  to set the global display layout. You can also  configure views for st rips individually (see Changing Dis-
play Module Views From the Surface ).
The USB connectors are used to service and unclaim a Display Module from an S6 system. Do not insert a USB drive for any other 
reason unless instructed to do so by an Avid technician.

(Pro Tools Only)
High resolution Gain Reduction Meters are di splayed on Display Module s and the Ma ster Module Home  page. Lower resolution 
Gain Reduction Meters (green) are displaye d on the Fader Module between the two Level Meters. S6 gain reduction meters follow 
the metering preference setting in the DAW, letting you ch oose to see compression, expansion, or a sum of both. 
Dynamics Graphs with bouncing level ball can be displayed on Disp lay and Master Modules by enabling any of the Function  
views. (Not all dynamics plug-ins sup port graphs or bouncing level ball.) 
Global Track Type Meter
You can change the Display layout for all tr acks of the same type, globally, using th e Display Global Mete r Layout channel key.  
This lets you use different meter layouts for audio tracks versus  Auxiliary Inputs. Gl obal configurations are stored in User se ttings, 
individual meter strips are stored in Layouts.
To change the global meter layout for all tracks of the same type: 
1Create a custom channel key and assign it to Display Global Meter Layout . 
2For another way to change the meter layout for the current strip only, create a custom channel key for Display Meter Layout . 
Note that if a recalled layout included meter type, its settin g will be applied and replace the current tr ack or global meter l ayout. 
You can also see and configur e global meter layouts using Display Track Type . Figure 124. PEC/DIR meters on a Master Post Display Module (MDM)

Part VII: Appendix


Appendix A: GPIO 293Appendix A: GPIO
GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) is an interface protocol to interconnect machines to perform various functions. The 25-pin 
D-Sub connector on the back panel of the Ma ster Module (see Figure 127) provides 8 cha nnels of GPI input and 8 channels of GPO. 
The inputs are opto-isolated, and the outputs are relays. Switch es used for GPI input must be momentary (not latching). 
Basic (legacy)  S4/S6 lets you define GP inputs and outputs to cont rol Talkback, Monitoring, an d basic Transport commands. 
Advanced  GPIO are also provided in the Soft Ke y Editor for greater flexibility and optio ns, and include Fader Start and Glide from 
a GPI. 
To enable basic (legacy) GPI: 
1Navigate to Settings  > Preferences . 
2In the GPIO section, enable any of the following: 
• Talkback Enabled
• Monitoring Enabled (Dim, Cut)• Transport Enabled (Stop, Play, Record)
Advanced GPIO and Fader Glide
On S4/S6, GPIO are provided in the Soft Key Editor for greater flexibility and options , and include Fader Glide. 
• The Master Module GPIO page of the Soft Key Editor lets you assign specific GP in puts (1–8) to trigger S4/S6 Soft Keys, and 
assign S4/S6 Soft Keys to trig ger specific GP outputs (1–8). 
• Fader Glide lets a GP input, or any surface  Soft Key, trigger a specific fader to gl ide to a designated level at a prescribed rate. 
You can specify Fader Glide to apply to only the attentioned st rip or to any specific fader stri p, all strips in a “bucket” (8- fader 
chassis), strips in all buckets or any st rip on the surface. Fader Glide provides a si ngle set of settings (affecting any/all e nabled 
Fader Glide strips) for Fader Start Glide Time, and Fader Start Target. 
You can apply these GPIO capabilities to be able to have differ ent commands on different GPIOs, to have a greater number of 
S4/S6 commands trigger or be triggered by GP IO such as monitoring commands, Transport, turn on Record lights, turn off AC (air 
conditioning), and similar.See also “Auto Talkback” on page 54 . 
Figure 125. GPIO settings in Settings > Preferences
Note that the legacy GPIO func tions (Talkback, Monito ring Cut/Dim, and Transport Play/Stop/Re cord) are still av ailable but will  
be automatically di sabled if a GPIO Soft Key is define d that includes the same function. To  restore the prev ious functionality you 
must first disable any and al l GPIO Soft Keys assigned to that same function.

Appendix A: GPIO 294Soft Key Colo r Indication
Soft Key color lets you quickly see what type  of Soft Key is actually turning on a GPO.
• If a GPO surface Soft Key is activating a GPO and it is applied to a Soft Key that can show colo r it will light that Soft Key 
purple. 
• If the GPO surface Soft Key is not actually the Soft Key that is turning on the GPO, but the same GPO is being activated by 
some other Soft Key that is applied directly to the GPO, th en the surface Soft Key will ligh t with the color applied by the 
appset. 
• If any Soft Key is applied to a GPIO or if one of the latchi ng/momentary GPO surface Soft Keys are applied to any other Soft 
Key, then the default hard-coded GPIO f unctionality (Transport, Monitor and Talkback ) will be disabled until the GPIO soft 
keys are no longer applie d by any Soft Key area. 
Fader Start GPO
Fader Start Output Trigger lets you trigger a GPO when a fader is  moved from -inf to any other value, and turn off when the fad er 
is moved back to –inf. You can configure Fa der Start Output Trigger to listen to the current Attention fade r, any specific fade r, any 
fader in one or any chassis (“bu cket”), or any/all faders on the surface (inclu ding the Automation M odule attent ion fader). 
To configure Fader Start GPO:
1Navigate to Settings > System .
2In the GPIO section, configure Fader Start Output Trigger  to the desired trigger level ( –inf/off  to +12 dB ).

Appendix A: GPIO 296To configure Fader Glide: 
1Navigate to Settings  > System . 
2In the GPIO section, configure Fader Start Glide Time  and Fader Start Target.  
Fader Start Glide Time  (0.0–3.0 seconds) determines the am ount of time the fader will take to travel to the designated Fader 
Start Target  level (-inf/off to +12 dB).
