A Few Words of Thanks 
Thank you for purchasing the Prophet-6. We take a lot of pleasure in creating all 
of our instruments but bringing the Prophet-6 to life was particularly satisfying. In many ways it brings my 40-plus years of designing synthesizers full circle. I’ll tell you why.
In 2014, two events occurred that led to the creation of the Prophet-6. The first 
was a fairly common one around our office — our usual informal discussion about what would be interesting to build next. (We don’t do marketing surveys around here.) We all agreed that an analog poly synth with true voltage-controlled oscillators, filters, and amplifiers would not only be exciting to design, but would also almost certainly sound great. So we decided to do it. 
Event two transpired when, unknown to me, my old friend and collaborator in the 
creation of MIDI, Ikutaro Kakehashi, founder of Roland, asked Yamaha Corporation to consider returning ownership of my original company brand, Sequential Circuits, to me. (Yamaha had purchased Sequential’s assets when we closed shop back in 1987.) Yamaha generously agreed and suddenly Sequential was back — almost. All we needed was an awesome new product to bear the name. 
Well, you know how the story ends: with the very synth you’ve just purchased. We 
figured that building the best-sounding analog poly synth possible would be a fitting tribute to Sequential’s most famous instrument, the Prophet-5, the poly synth that started it all.
The Sequential Prophet-6 takes the best qualities of the Prophet-5 and adds some nice 
touches that the original never had, such as stereo outputs, velocity and aftertouch 
sensitivity, dual digital effects, a high-pass filter, a polyphonic step sequencer, an 
arpeggiator, and of course, MIDI. The result is a synth with vintage analog tone and 
the reliability of a state-of-the-art, modern instrument.
I hope you enjoy the Prophet-6 as much as we enjoyed designing it for you.
Cheers,

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Getting Started
Getting Started
The Prophet-6 is a six-voice, polyphonic analog synthesizer with 
voltage-controlled oscillators, filters, and amplifiers. It was designed to provide all of the warmth and presence of a vintage-era synth with the added convenience and stability of a state-of-the-art, modern instrument.
The Prophet-6 is first and foremost a performance instrument. All of its 
sound-shaping controls are immediately accessible on its front panel, packing a tremendous amount of power and versatility into a compact, easy-to-use format.
You can find in-depth information about each of the Prophet-6’s parame-
ters in later sections of this manual. But don’t hesitate to dive right in and start turning knobs and pressing buttons before you begin reading. You can always get back to where you started, even if you have no idea what you’re doing. So start exploring and keep your ears and mind open!

Dave Smith InstrumentsSound Banks
The Prophet-6 contains a total of 1000 programs. 500 are permanent and 
500 can be overwritten. Banks 0-4 are User Banks that can be overwrit -
ten. Banks 5-9 are Factory Banks that are permanent. You can edit the programs of either bank, but you can only save them to Banks 0-4. As shipped from the factory, presets 000-499 are identical to 500-999.

Program bank, tens, and number selectors
Selecting Programs
Use the bank , tens, and program  selector  buttons to select and recall 
programs.
To choose a program:
1. Hold down the bank  button then press a program  selector  button (0-9) 
to specify the “hundreds” bank of the program.
2. Hold down the tens button then press a program  selector  button (0-9) 
to specify the “tens” digit of the program. 
3. Press a program  selector  button (0-9) to specify the “ones” digit of the 
program. 
To choose program 123, for example:
1. Hold bank  and press  1. Then release the bank  button.
2. Hold tens and press 2. Then release the tens button.
3. Press program  selector  button 3.


3
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Getting Started
It’s not always necessary to enter all 3 digits of a program number to 
recall it.
For example:
• If the current program is 100 and you want to recall program 101, simply press “1.”
• If the current program is 100 and you want to recall program 110, hold down the 
tens button and press “1.”
• If the current program is 100 and you want to recall program 115, hold down the 
tens button and press “1.” Then release the tens button and 
press “5.”
Pressing the globals  button three times in a row saves the current program as 
the default program that appears when you turn on the Prophet-6.
Editing Programs
Because all of the sound-shaping controls of the Prophet-6 appear on its front panel, editing an existing program is simple: just turn a knob and listen to its effect. Keep turning knobs and pressing buttons and if you like what you’ve created, save the program. (See “Saving Programs” on page 5.)
The rotary controls on the front panel are a mixture of “endless” rotary encoders 
and potentiometers or “pots.” You can choose between three different modes that determine how the synth reacts when parameters are edited with a pot. For details, see “Pot Mode” on page 13.
Comparing an Edited Program to its Original State
When editing a program, it’s often useful to compare its edited state to its original state to evaluate your edits. Alternatively, before saving a program to a new location you may want to check the program in the target location before you overwrite it.
To compare an edited program to a saved version:
1. Edit a program.
2. Press the write  button. It starts flashing.


4 Getting Started
Dave Smith Instruments3. Press the global  button. Both LEDs on the button light up, indicating 
compare  mode.
4. Play the keyboard to hear the saved version of the sound.
5. To disable the compare function and return to the edited sound, turn off 
the global  button. Programs can’t be written while in compare mode.
6. If you want to save the edited sound, the write  button is still flash -
ing and ready to save, so enter a location with the program  selector  
buttons. The sound is saved.
7. Alternatively, if you want to cancel saving and continue editing, press the 
write  button. It stops flashing and saving is canceled.
Creating a Program from Scratch
An existing program can be very useful as a jumping off point for new sounds. But it’s also useful (and educational) to create a new sound from scratch. The Prophet-6 makes this easy by providing a “Basic Preset” that you can quickly recall at any time. This preset is very simple, with a single oscillator as its basis. 
To recall the Basic Preset:
1. Hold down the preset  button. 
2. Press the write  button.
Live Panel Mode
The Prophet-6 also features a “live panel” mode in which its sound switches to the current settings of its knobs and switches. In other words, the current preset is ignored and what you see on the front panel is what you hear. This is a great mode for learning, experimentation, and instant gratification.
To enter live panel mode:
• Press the preset  button to toggle it off. Note that you can’t change 
programs or banks with Preset off.
To return to preset mode:
• Press the preset  button again to toggle it on.

PRESET
Toggling off the preset  button enables “live panel” mode
Saving a Program
If you’ve created a sound that you like, you’ll probably want to save it. 
Saving a program overwrites a previously saved program. Sound design -
ers often save many incremental versions of a program as they continue to refine it. These intermediate versions often make good jumping off points for new sounds. 
To save a program to the same preset location:
1. Press the  write  button. Its LED begins blinking.
2. Press a program  selector  button (0-9) to specify the “ones” digit of the 
program. 
3. The write  button LED stops blinking and the program is saved.
Be careful when write  is enabled. You can change banks and tens without 
executing write , but once you press a program  selector  button (0-9) for the “ones” 
digit, the write  command is executed and the program at that location is overwritten.
To save a program to a different bank location:
1. Press the  write  button. Its LED begins blinking.
2. Hold down the bank  button then press a program  selector  button to 
specify the “hundreds” bank of the program. You can only save to Banks 0-4.
3. Hold down the 
tens button then press a program  selector  button (0-9) 
to specify the “tens” digit of the program. 
4. Press a program  selector  button (0-9) to specify the “ones” digit of the 
program. 
5. The write  button LED stops blinking and the program is saved.


6 Getting Started
Dave Smith InstrumentsCanceling Save
Sometimes you may want to cancel saving a program before you 
commit.
To cancel the Save process before you commit:
• If the write  button LED is flashing, press it again. The LED stops flash-
ing and saving is canceled. You can return to editing if you want.
Comparing Before You Save
Before saving a program to a new location, it’s a good idea to listen to the 
program in the target location to make sure you really want to overwrite it. 
To evaluate a program before you overwrite it:
1. Get ready to save by pressing the write  button. It starts flashing.
2. Press the global  button. Both LEDs on the button light up, indicating 
compare  mode.
3. Use the program buttons to navigate to the sound you want to compare and play the keyboard to hear the sound.
4. To disable the compare function and go back to the edited sound, turn off the 
global  button. Programs can’t be written while in compare 
mode.
5. If you want to save the edited sound, the write  button is still flashing 
and ready to save, so enter a location with the program buttons. The sound is saved.
6. Alternatively, if you want to cancel saving and continue editing, press the 
write  button. It stops flashing and saving is canceled.

Moving to the Next Level
The Prophet-6 is filled with possibilities for sound creation. Although 
we realize that you’d rather spend your time exploring its capabilities, we’d like to point you toward a few things that will help you tailor the instrument to your needs. 
First, check out the Global Settings  section of this manual. Read about 
Pot Modes and determine which works best for you when you’re editing 
sounds. You’ll also find information about MIDI setup. Read this to more effectively integrate the Prophet-6 into your MIDI rig. To get the most out of the Prophet-6’s live performance capabilities, read up on using a footswitch or expression pedal. 
And finally, be on the lookout for tips and notes scattered throughout this 
manual to gain a better working knowledge of the Prophet-6. The better you know your instrument, the more you’ll get out of it. We wish you many hours of musical exploration!

3 . MIDI Clock: Sets the Prophet-6’s ability to send and receive MIDI 
clock messages:
•  Off: MIDI Clock is neither sent nor received
•  Out: MIDI Clock is sent, but not received
•  In: MIDI Clock is received, but not sent
• Slave Thru (i-0): MIDI Clock is received and passed to MIDI Out 
• In, No Start/Stop (n55 ): Receives MIDI Clock but does not respond to 
MIDI Start or Stop command.
When set to in or slave  thru , if no MIDI clock is present at the selected input, 
the arpeggiator and sequencer will not function .


12 Global Settings
Dave Smith Instruments4 . Clock Port: MID , USB —Sets the ports, MIDI or USB, by which MIDI 
clock signals are received.
5 . Param Xmit: Off , CC, NR—Changes to the values of front panel 
controls are transmitted via MIDI as Continuous Controllers (CC) or Non-
registered Parameter Number (NR). Transmission of parameters can also be turned off. You could, for example, turn the filter 
cutoff  frequence knob on 
the Prophet-6 and have it affect the cutoff frequency of another synthesizer. For a list of Prophet-6 CCs and NRPNs, see Appendix D.
NRPNs are the preferred method of parameter transmission, since they cover 
the complete range of all parameters, while CCs are limited to a range of 128.
6 . Param Rcv:  Off, CC, NR—Sets the method by which parameter changes are 
received via MIDI. As with transmission, NRPNs are the preferred method.
7 . MIDI Control:  Off, On—When On, the synth will respond to MIDI 
controllers, including Pitch Wheel, Mod Wheel, Pedal, V olume.
8 . MIDI Sysex: MID , USB — When set to MIDI ( MID) it will receive 
and transmit them using the MIDI ports/cables When set to USB it will receive and transmit them using the USB port/cable. MIDI SysEx messages are used when sending and receiving a variety of data includ -
ing, programs, alternative tunings, system updates, and more.  
9 . MIDI Out:  MID, USB —Sets the port by which MIDI data will be trans -
mitted (MIDI or USB).


13
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Global Settings
Globals - Bottom Row
0 . Local Control:  Off, On—When on (the default), the keyboard and 
front panel controls directly affect the Prophet-6. When off, the controls 
are transmitted via MIDI but do not directly affect the “local” synth (that is, the Prophet-6). This is primarily useful for avoiding MIDI data loops that can occur with some external sequencers.
1 . Seq Jack: NOR , Tri, Gat , T-g  (Normal, Trigger, Gate, T-G)— Selects 
the mode for signals received on the rear-panel Sequencer jack. 
• With normal  selected, a footswitch will start sequencer playback. 
• With trig selected, an audio signal connected to the sequencer  jack will 
step the sequencer when the sequencer’s play button is on. 
• With gate selected, an audio signal connected to the sequencer  
jack will trigger and gate the envelopes while you hold a note or chord. Additionally, turning on the sequencer or arpeggiator will add sequencer or arpeggiator playback—but controlled by the Prophet-6’ s 
clock 
bpm and v alue  settings and not the audio trigger. 
• With t-g (trigger +gate) selected, an audio signal connected to the 
sequencer  jack will trigger and gate the envelopes while you hold a 
note or chord. Additionally, pressing the sequencer’s play button will 
also add synchronized sequencer playback. 
For best results when triggering the sequencer with an audio signal, use a loud 
signal with a sharp attack/decay and little or no sustain.
2 . Pot Mode:  Rel, Pas , Jup  (Relative, Passthru, Jump)— The rotary controls 
on the front  panel are a mixture of “endless” rotary encoders and potenti -
ometers or “pots.” The pots are identifiable by their lined knobs and the fact that they have about 300° of travel. There are three pot modes to deter -
mine how the synth reacts when the programmable parameters are edited. (Master volume is not programmable, so these modes don’t apply.)
In Relative mode, changes are relative to the stored setting. In Relative mode, the 
full value range is not available until either the minimum or maximum value and the respective lower or upper limit of the pot’s travel is reached.
 For example, 
the resonance  parameter has an internal value range of 0 to 127. Let’s 
say the physical position of the resonance pot is the equivalent to a 


14 Global Settings
Dave Smith Instrumentsvalue of 100. If you switch to a program that has a stored Resonance 
setting of 63 and turn the pot all the way up, it will only go to 90. To get to the maximum value of 127, you first have to turn down until the value is at the other extreme and the pot is at the limit of its travel (in this case, 0 and fully counter-clockwise, respectively).
In Passthru mode, turning the pot has no effect until after the edited 
value equals the preset value (that is, until the edited value “passes through” the stored value). 
Jump mode uses an absolute value based upon the position of the pot 
when edited: turn a pot and the value jumps immediately from the stored value to the edited value.
3 . Sustain +/- :  Nor, Rev , n-r , r-n  (Normally Open, Normally Closed, 
Sustain Normally Open/Sequencer Normally Closed, Sustain Normally 
Closed/Sequencer Normally Open)— The Sustain pedal polarity param -
eter affects both the sustain pedal and sequencer jack input ports. There 
are two types of momentary footswitches, normally open and normally closed. Either type can be used with the Prophet-6. Not sure which type you have? If the behavior of the footswitch is the opposite of what is expected — that is, down is off and up is on — changing this setting will correct that.
4 . Alt Tuning:  Nor, 1…16 (Normal, 1…16)— Selects one of the Prophet-6’s 
built-in tunings. Set to normal , the tuning is standard, chromatic tuning. 
Choosing 1 through 16 selects an alternative, non-chromatic, non-Western scale that can be used to emulate ethnic instruments or in other creative ways. 
See “Appendix A: Alternative Tunings” on page 59 for a description of 
each tuning. Additional tunings can be imported into the Prophet-6 as a SysEx message. For more information, see Appendix A.
5 . Vel Response: 0-3 (Curve 0, Curve 1, Curve 2, Curve 3)— Sets one of four 
velocity curves to adjust the keyboard’s velocity response to your playing style.
6 . AT Response: 0-3 (Curve 0, Curve 1, Curve 2, Curve 3)— Sets one of 
four pressure curves to adjust the keyboard’s aftertouch response to your playing style.

7 . Stereo/Mono:  Ste, Mon  (Stereo, Mono)— The Prophet-6 defaults to 
stereo operation. When set to Mono, this parameter defeats all pan settings 
and modulation, effectively making each of the outputs a mono output.
8 . Pgm Dump: Prg, Ten , Ban , usr , All  (Program, Tens, Bank, User 
Banks, All)— Transmits the current program, ten programs from the 
currently selected bank and tens location, the current bank, all user banks (0-4), or all banks (both user and factory) in SysEx format via the selected MIDI port. (See: “MIDI Sysex.”) Dumped programs will load back into the same bank and program location in memory when received by the Prophet-6 via MIDI. 
Oscillators
Oscillators provide the raw building blocks of the Prophet-6’s sound by producing waveforms, each of which has its own inherent sound charac -
ter based on its harmonic content. The Prophet-6 has two oscillators, plus a sub oscillator and a noise generator per voice. Level controls for each of these are located in the Mixer section.
Each oscillator is capable of generating triangle, sawtooth, and variable-
width pulse waves. These waveshapes are continuously variable and smoothly transition from one shape to the next as you turn the 
shape  
knob. This provides a variety of “in-between” waveshapes. 
 The oscillators on the Prophet-6 are extremely stable. To emulate the random 
pitch drift and oscillator instability of vintage instruments, use the slop parameter to 
dial in as little or as much drift as you like.

Dave Smith InstrumentsOscillator 1 can be hard-synced to Oscillator 2 for complex, harmoni -

Oscillator 2 features a fine knob for detuning and thickening sounds, 
a low freq switch that allows it to function as an LFO for modulation 
purposes, and a keyboard  switch that disables keyboard control over its 
pitch (useful when used as an LFO, or for drones and other effects). 
Oscillator Parameters
Frequency: Sets the base oscillator frequency over a 9-octave range from 
16 Hz to 8KHz (when used with the Transpose buttons). Adjustment is in 
semitones. 
The global Master Tune settings affect the pitch of all oscillators. See “Globals - 
Top Row” on page 11 for more information.
Fine: Fine tune control with a range of a quartertone up or down. The 12 
o’clock position is centered. Steps are in cents (50 cents = 1/2 semitone).
Shape: Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse— Used to select the waveshape 
generated by the oscillator. Waveshapes are continuously variable and smoothly transition from one shape to the next as you turn the 
shape  
knob. This provides a variety of “in-between” waveshapes.
Pulse Width:  Changes the width of the pulse wave from a square wave 
when the pulse  width  knob is at center position, to a very narrow pulse 
wave when the pulse  width  knob is full left or right. 
Applying pulse width modulation using poly mod or the low frequency  oscillator  
is a great way to add movement and thickness to a sound, especially when creating pad or string-like sounds.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Oscillators
Sync: Off, On —Turns Oscillator 1 hard sync on. Sync forces Oscillator 
1 (the slave) to restart its cycle every time Oscillator 2 (the master) starts 
a cycle. This provides a way to create more complex, harmonically rich shapes from simple waveforms—especially when the frequency of Oscil -
lator 1 is set to a different interval than Oscillator 2.

Low Frequency:  Off, On —Turns Oscillator 2 into a low-frequency 
oscillator, essentially providing another LFO source for modulation 
using Poly Mod. The frequency , fine, shape , and pulse  width  controls 
still apply and will affect the character of any low-frequency modulation applied using Oscillator 2. 
Keyboard: Off, On —When off, the Oscillator 2 ignores the keyboard 
and note data received via MIDI and plays at its base frequency setting. Oscillator 2 pitch can still be affected by modulation from other sources when in this mode.


18 Slop
Dave Smith InstrumentsSlop
Slop adds randomized detuning to the oscillators to emulate the tuning 
instability of vintage analog oscillators. This tuning instability is a big part of what made vintage instruments sound characteristically warm and fat.
Because the Prophet-6 oscillators are extremely stable, small amounts 
of Slop can help impart a very vintage tone to what is otherwise a very stable, modern instrument. Slop amount is adjustable from subtle, barely perceptible amounts to wildly out of tune.
The global Master Tune settings affect the pitch of all oscillators. See “Globals - 
Top Row” on page 11 for more information.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Mixer
Mixer
The Mixer section is where you set the levels of the various sound 
generators on the Prophet-6. These include Oscillator 1, Oscillator 2, Sub Octave (Oscillator 1 sub oscillator) and the white noise generator. You must turn up at least one of these in order to make sound with the Prophet-6. (Alternatively, you can use the filter to generate its own sine wave in self-oscillating mode.)
   Rather than limit the Prophet-6’s outputs to keep the instrument from clipping, 
we allow you to adjust levels at various points in its signal path. This gives you the option to “overload” things in interesting ways, if you wish to do so. If not, try reducing the levels of the oscillators in the 
mixer  section, the env amount  parameter in the Ampli-
fier Envelope, or the resonance  parameter in either the low-pass or high-pass filter.
OSC 1 OSC 2
SUB OCTAVE NOISEMIXER
The Mixer
Osc 1: Sets the output level of Oscillator 1.
Osc 2: Sets the output level of Oscillator 2.
Sub Octave: Controls the level of a triangle wave oscillator pitched one 
octave below Oscillator 1. Because a triangle wave has few harmonics and is mainly characterized by its fundamental frequency, adding a sub octave to sounds such as bass are a great way to increase their low-register presence. 
Noise: Sets the output level of the white noise generator.


20 Filters
Dave Smith InstrumentsFilters
Filters take the basic, raw sound of the oscillators and noise generator 
and subtract frequencies, changing the harmonic content and character of their sound. This change can be varied over time using the Filter Enve -
lope to produce more dynamic, animated timbres. 
The Prophet-6’s two-filter architecture allows for a wide range of sonic 
possibilities. The Low-Pass Filter is a 4-pole, 24 dB per-octave, resonant filter. The High-Pass Filter is a 2-pole, 12 dB per octave, resonant filter. 
In simple terms, the Low-Pass Filter cuts high frequencies and the High-
Pass Filter cuts low frequencies. If used at the same time, the two filters act as a band-pass filter, passing only the band of frequencies that fall between the high-pass and low-pass cutoff points.

Cutoff: Sets the filter’s cutoff frequency. On the Low-Pass Filter, 
frequencies are reduced from the top down — cutting the high frequen -
cies and passing the low, hence the name “low-pass.” On the High-Pass Filter, frequencies are reduced from the bottom up — cutting the low frequencies and passing the high, hence the name “high-pass.” 
Resonance: Emphasizes a narrow band of frequencies around the cutoff 
frequency. On the Low-Pass Filter, high levels of resonance can cause the filter to self oscillate and generate its own pitch. 


21
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Filters
High levels of resonance can sometimes cause the Prophet-6 outputs to clip 
if its sound generators are also set to high output in the Mixer. Monitor your outputs 
carefully to ensure optimal, clean signal levels. If you experience signal clipping, try reducing the levels of the oscillators in the 
mixer  section, the env amount  parameter in 
the Amplifier Envelope, or the resonance  parameter in either the low-pass or high-pass 
filter.
Env Amount: Sets the amount of modulation from the filter envelope to 
the filters. Higher amounts more dramatically affect the cutoff frequency. This control is bipolar. Positive settings produce standard behavior as described in “Filter Envelope” on page 22. Negative settings invert the envelope. Experiment with this control to create a variety of expressive filtering effects. 
Velocity: on, off —When enabled, allows key velocity to influence filter 
frequency. If the env amount  is set to a positive value on the low-pass 
filter, the harder you play, the more the filter will open and the brighter the sound will be. Conversely, if the 
env amount  is set to a negative 
value, the harder you play, the more the filter will close and the less bright the sound will be. This control makes for more touch-sensitive sounds
Keyboard: off, half, full —Sets the amount of modulation from the 
keyboard to the filter’s cutoff frequency. Selecting half or full means 
that the higher the note played on the keyboard, the more the filter opens. This is useful for adding brightness to a sound as higher notes are played, which is typically how acoustic instruments behave. If both 
half and full 
are off, keyboard filter tracking is off, meaning that filter frequency is unaf-fected by playing higher or lower notes on the keyboard.
On the Low-Pass Filter, setting keyboard  to full when the filter is self oscillating 
will cause the filter-generated pitch to follow the keyboard in tune (i.e. in semitones). Setting the 
keyboard  to half will cause the filter-generated pitch to follow the keyboard 
pitch in quarter tones.


22 Filter Envelope
Dave Smith InstrumentsFilter Envelope
The Prophet-6’s low-pass and high-pass filters share a dedicated, four-
stage envelope generator. The Filter Envelope is used to shape the harmonic characteristics of a synthesized sound by giving you filtering control over its attack, decay, sustain, and release stages. 
This is one of the most important factors in designing a sound. Without 
an envelope, the filters would be completely static. They would stay open or closed by a fixed amount that wouldn’t change over the duration of a sound. That’s not very interesting to listen to and it’s not how instru-ments behave in the real world. 
In general, sounds produced by an instrument are brighter at their begin -
ning (the attack stage) and grow mellower as they die out (the decay 
and release stages). In other words, their harmonic content changes over time. This is exactly what the filter envelope is designed to emulate.

23
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Filter Envelope
Attack:  Sets the attack time of the envelope. The higher the setting, the 
slower the attack time and the longer it takes for the filter(s) to open to 
the level set with the filter  cutoff  knob. Percussive sounds typically have 
sharp (short) attacks.
Decay:  Sets the decay time of the envelope. After a sound reaches the 
filter frequency set at its attack stage, decay  controls how quickly the 
filter then transitions to the cutoff frequency set with the sustain  knob. 
The higher the setting, the longer the decay. Percussive sounds, such as synth bass, typically have shorter decays (and a generous amount of low-pass filter resonance).
Sustain: Sets the filter cutoff frequency for the sustained portion of the 
sound. The sound will stay at this filter frequency for as long as a note is held on the keyboard.
Release:  Sets the release time of the envelope. This controls how 
quickly the filter closes after a note is released.
The description of envelope behavior above is true when the envelope  amount  
parameter is set to a positive value. But since this control is actually bi-polar, it is possible to set a negative amount of modulation. In this case, the envelopes are inverted and their behavior changes. The best way to get a feel for the difference is to experiment with both positive and negative settings of the 
envelope  amount  parameter. 
The cutoff frequency setting may limit the effect of the envelope on the filter. For 
example, on the low-pass filter, if cutoff  is at its highest setting, a positive envelope 
amount will have no effect on the filter since the filter is already completely open.
Changing the Filter Envelope’s Response Curve
By default, the envelopes of all synthesizers are designed to have certain type of response curve that is largely dependent on the preference of the designer. In most cases, this can’t be changed. The current preference is that the faster or snappier the envelopes, the better.
However, in the case of the Prophet-6, there is a hidden feature in the 
Poly Mod section that allows you to modify the responsiveness of the Filter Envelope’s ADSR controls. This opens up a new level of fine adjustment of these controls that is subtle but powerful. Try it and see.


24 Amplifier Envelope
Dave Smith InstrumentsTo adjust the responsiveness of the filter envelope:
1. Select a program — such as a synth brass sound — that has a slightly 
soft but bright attack. 
2. Repeatedly play a series of notes or chords on the keyboard, so you can hear the effect of the adjustments as you follow the steps below.
3. In the Poly Mod section, enable the 
lp filter  as the only destination 
(disable all other Poly Mod destinations such as freq 1, freq 2  etc.).
4. In the Poly Mod section, turn the filter  env control slightly counter -
clockwise. Try a setting of about 11 o’clock.
5. Continue to play a series of chords and turn the env amount  knob 
clockwise in the low-pass filter  section. Try moving it back and forth 
between 1 o’clock and 3 o’clock.
6.  As you do this, compare different settings of the Poly Mod filter  env 
control, the Low-Pass Filter env amount , and different Attack, Decay, 
Sustain, and Release settings on the Filter Envelope. 
The interaction of these controls is worth exploring for greater flexibility and control of the Filter Envelope.
Amplifier Envelope
After passing through the filters, a synthesized sound goes into an analog voltage controlled amplifier or VCA, which controls its overall loudness. The VCA has a dedicated, four-stage envelope generator. 
The Amplifier Envelope is used to shape the volume characteristics of 
a sound over time by giving you control over its attack, decay, sustain, and release stages. Along with the filter envelope, this is one of the most important factors in designing a sound. 
Without a volume envelope, the loudness of a sound wouldn’t change 
over the duration of a note. It would begin immediately, remain at its full volume for the duration of the note, then end immediately when the note was released. Again, that’s not very interesting sonically and it’s not typi-cally how instruments behave in the real world. 


25
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Amplifier Envelope
To give you a real-world example, the main difference between the 
sound of the wind and the sound of a snare drum is that they have very different volume envelopes. Otherwise, they are essentially both white noise. Wind has a relatively slow attack, a long sustain, and a long decay and release. A snare drum has a sharp attack, no sustain, and virtually no decay or release. But again, they are both fundamentally white noise.

Attack:  Sets the attack time of the envelope. The higher the setting, the 
slower the attack time and the longer it takes for a sound to reach its full volume. Pads typically have softer (longer) attacks. Percussive sounds have sharper (shorter) attacks.
Decay:  Sets the decay time of the envelope. After a sound reaches its full 
volume at its attack stage, decay  controls how quickly the sound transi -
tions to the level set with the sustain  control. The higher the setting, the 
longer the decay. Percussive sounds, such as synth bass, typically have shorter decays.
Sustain: Sets the sustain level of the envelope. The higher the setting, 
the louder the sustained portion of the sound will be. The sound will stay at this level for as long as a note is held on the keyboard.


26 Effects
Dave Smith InstrumentsRelease:  Sets the release time of the envelope. This controls how 
quickly a sound dies out after a note is released.
Env Amount: Sets the amount of modulation from the Amplifier Enve -
lope to the VCA. In most cases you will probably want to set this fully 
clockwise for maximum VCA volume. If you experience signal clipping, try reducing the 
env amount  or the levels of the oscillators in the mixer  
section.
 To recreate the “gated VCA” effect used on certain classic rock anthems, 
choose an organ sound, then set the vca env amount to zero, route the LFO square 
wave to amp with an initial  amt setting of 100% and hold a few chords.   
Velocity: This button enables keyboard velocity to modulate the VCA 
Envelope Amount. The harder you play, the more the VCA envelope is affected. This makes for more touch-sensitive sounds.
Effects
The Prophet-6 effects  section allows you to add up to two, 24-bit, 48 kHz 
digital effects to any sound. Though the Prophet-6 sounds great on its own, adding a touch of reverb or delay can enhance many sounds with a subtle (or not so subtle) sense of ambience and depth. Other effects such as the chorus and phaser are useful for adding more conspicuous tonal enhance -
ment as well as emulating classic instruments such as string ensembles and so on.
While the effects themselves are digital, the main signal path of the 
Prophet-6 is analog, with the effects generated in a separate audio chain, converted to analog, then added to the main signal path using the 
mix 
knob. The on/off switch enables and disables both Effect A and Effect B, 
using a true bypass, ensuring a pure analog signal path.
Effects settings are saved individually with each program. Time-based 
effects such as the Delays can be synchronized to the arpeggiator, sequencer, or MIDI clock to produce repeats that occur on the beat.

and configure.
3. Turn the type knob to select an effect. Names are abbreviated. For 
instance “bbd” is the bucket-brigade delay. Refer to the list above. 
4. Turn the mix knob to the right to blend in a good amount of the processed

settings. You can dial it down afterward.
5. Use the parameter 1 and parameter 2 knobs to adjust the effect’s param-eters to your taste. See “Effects Parameters” on page 29 for details on the adjustable parameters on each effect type.
6. Finally, adjust the 
mix knob to optimize the amount of the effect. Full 
left is completely dry. Full right is completely wet (a 100% processed signal).
7. Repeat as needed to add a second effect. 
Main Parameters
On/Off:  Turns both effects, A and B, on and off. The on/off switch uses a 
true bypass, ensuring a pure analog signal path.
Effect: A, B —Selects either effect A or B for editing. Once selected, all 
adjustments apply to that effect.
Type: Off, bbd, ddl, CHO, PH1, PH2, HAL, rOO, PLA, SPr—Selects the effect type.
Mix: 0...127—Sets the balance between the processed (wet) signal 
and unprocessed (dry) signal. Full left is completely dry. Full right is completely wet.
Clock Sync: On , Off —When a delay effect is chosen, this enables syncing 
of the timed delay repeats (feedback) to the Arpeggiator, Sequencer, or MIDI clock. When Sync is on, delay time provides the following values:

Maximum delay time is 1 second. The combination of longer synced delay 
times with slower tempos can result in delay times that would be greater than 1 
second. When that happens, the delay time is divided by 2 until it no longer exceeds the 1 second limit. For example, if the BPM is set to 60 and Delay Time is set to Half, the expected delay time would be 2 seconds. The actual delay time will be 1 second (i.e. 2 seconds divided by 2).
Parameter 1:  Variable, depending on the effect —This knob adjusts 
parameter 1 for the chosen effect. Each effect has two adjustable param -
eters, which differ depending on the effect. See “Effects Parameters” on page 29 for details about the adjustable parameters on each effect type.
Parameter 2:  
Variable, depending on the effect —This knob adjusts

Low Frequency Oscillators
The LFO is a special-purpose oscillator that produces a frequency below 
the range of human hearing. The LFO is typically used for periodic modulation such as vibrato (periodic pitch modulation) and tremolo (periodic amplitude modulation). 
The LFO on the Prophet-6 produces a variety of waveshapes, including 
triangle, sawtooth, reverse sawtooth, square, and random. Though most often used for low-frequency modulation, the Prophet-6 LFO can actually function at speeds that extend into the audible range for extreme effects.

Triangle and Random waves are bipolar. That is, their waveshape is posi -
tive for half of their cycle and negative for the other half. In the case of the triangle wave, this makes it possible to generate a natural-sounding vibrato that goes alternately sharp and flat in equal amounts on either side of a center frequency. Random, also known as “sample and hold,” generates a series of random values, each held for the duration of one cycle
The square wave, sawtooth, and reverse sawtooth generate only positive 
values. In the case of the square wave this makes it possible to generate natural-sounding trills.

 The Prophet-6 has a sixth “hidden” LFO waveshape that you can use as a 
modulation source — noise. To access this, choose random  then turn frequency  all the 
way clockwise. This generates a white noise waveform.
The LFO can be free-running or synced to the arpeggiator, sequencer, or 
MIDI clock for tempo-synced effects such as filter sweeps, tremolo, and so on.
Frequency: Sets the frequency of the LFO waveshape routed to the 
destination. See also “LFO Sync” below.
LFO Sync:  When on, the LFO synchronizes with the arpeggiator, 
sequencer, or MIDI clock. By default, the LFO wave cycle is reset when you press a key (but is not reset if you press a key while other notes are held). 
Shape: Triangle, Sawtooth, Reverse Sawtooth, Square, Random —The 
wave shape of the LFO. A sixth waveshape, noise, can be generated by selecting 
random  and turning the frequency  knob all the way to the right. 
Initial Amount: Sets the amount of LFO modulation routed to the 
selected destinations. Setting an amount here applies the selected modu -
lation continuously. If you set this parameter to zero but still select a modulation destination, modulation is only applied when you use the Mod Wheel. 
Freq 1: Selects the frequency of Oscillator 1 as a modulation destination. 
Use a triangle wave as a source to create vibrato. Use a square wave to create trills.

Poly Mod
Although the overall sonic character of the Prophet-6 is determined by its analog oscillators and filters, much of its power to make truly unique and unusual sounds comes from the Poly Mod section.

34 Poly Mod
Dave Smith InstrumentsYou can control how much the source affects the destination by dialing in 
a specific modulation amount with the filter  env or osc 2 knobs. Modu-
lation amount can either be positive or negative.
Use Poly Mod to create complex harmonic effects ranging from FM 
(frequency modulation) to audio-rate filter modulation and beyond. Many classic sounds on the original Prophet-5 were created through clever use of Poly Mod.

that is applied to a selected destination. Modulation amount can be either positive or negative.
Osc 2: Selects the amount of modulation from Oscillator 2 that is applied 
to a selected destination. Modulation amount can be either positive or negative. 
 When using osc 2 as a modulation source, the modulation character is 
affected by the waveshape currently chosen for Oscillator 2 (triangle, sawtooth, or square/pulse). Try setting Oscillator 2 to low frequency (using the

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Arpeggiator
Arpeggiator
The Prophet-6 has a full-featured Arpeggiator. Turn it on, hold a chord 
and the Prophet-6 will play a pattern based on the individual notes held. Choose a mode (up, down, random, etc.), an octave range (1, 2, or 3), and a tempo, then pair it with an appropriately percussive sound, and you’ll be surprised at the number of creative things you can do.
When 
hold  is active, the Arpeggiator is in “relatch” mode, where play -
ing a new chord latches to the new chord rather than adding notes to the 
existing chord.
If you enable hold , you can release the notes on the keyboard and the 
Arpeggiator will continue to play. In addition, the Arpeggiator features 
auto-latching: With hold  on, played notes are held on and arpeggiated, 
and any additional notes you play are added to the arpeggio—as long as at least one key is continuously held. 
You can sync the Arpeggiator to external MIDI clock, or even an external 
audio signal. When the Arpeggiator is playing, the Sequencer is disabled.

Dave Smith Instruments An audio signal connected to the rear-panel footswitch  - sequence  jack can be 
used to control arpeggiator (and sequencer) playback. This makes it possible to tempo 
sync the arpeggiator to a recorded drum track or other audio source. See “Seq Jack” on page 13 for more information about choosing the appropriate mode for these behaviors.

Sequencer
The Prophet-6’s sequencer is similar to a classic step sequencer. It allows 
you to create a single sequence of up to 64 steps, including rests and ties, with up to 6 notes per step. In addition, you can play along with a sequence (provided there is available polyphony), making it a powerful live performance tool. When the Sequencer is playing, the Arpeggiator is disabled.

The Sequencer/Arpeggiator
 An audio signal connected to the rear-panel footswitch  - sequence  jack can 
be used to control sequencer playback. This makes it possible to tempo sync the sequencer (or arpeggiator) to a recorded drum track or other audio source. See “Seq Jack” on page 13 for more information about choosing the appropriate mode for these behaviors. 
Programming the Sequencer
Though programming the sequencer is simple, you can create sequences that are rhythmically and melodically complex by combining a repeating phrase or bass line with chords, ties, and rests. You can play up to 64 steps with up to 6 notes held simultaneously per step. For most sequences you’ll probably want to use sounds with a relatively sharp attack and short release.


38 Sequencer
Dave Smith InstrumentsMost factory programs have a sequence associated with them. Recall a 
program and press the Sequencer’s play button to hear its associated sequence.
To program a note sequence: 
1. Press the record  button.
2. Perform the sequence on the keyboard. The display indicates the 
current step as you play. 
When recording a chord as a step, as long as you continue to hold at least one 
note down, you can keep adding notes to the chord/step, and even use the transpose  
buttons to extend the keyboard range while doing it.
3. To add a rest as you play, press the tens/increment  button for that step, 
then continue playing. 
4. To add a “tie” that extends the length of a note, continue to hold down the note(s) and press the 
tens/increment  button repeatedly to extend the 
note the number of steps you want.
5. When you’re done, press play to listen to your sequence. 
6. To save the sequence, save the program and they are saved together. (See “Saving a Program” on page 5.)
If you want to play live along with the sequencer, be sure to leave voices avail -
able. In other words, don’t play 6-note chords for every step in the sequence!
To play a sequence:
1. Press play. The sequence plays back at the current BPM setting. 
2. To stop playback, press play again .
Alternatively, you can start and stop sequencer playback using a footswitch 
connected to the rear-panel seq jack or using MIDI start/stop messages sent from a 
DAW or other MIDI device. See “Seq Jack” on page 13 for more information. 
Use the bpm, value , or tap tempo  controls to adjust sequencer playback speed.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Sequencer
To transpose a sequence: 
1. Press play. The sequence begins playback. 
2. Press and hold record  and press a key on the keyboard. “Middle C” 
is the reference point. Playing a note above middle C transposes the 
sequence higher by that interval. Playing a note below middle C trans -
poses the sequence lower by that interval.
Sequencer Parameters
Here are the controls and parameters used when interacting with the sequencer.
Record: On, Off— This switch turns sequencer recording on and off.
Play: On, Off— This switch turns sequencer playback on and off.
BPM: 30…250— Sets the tempo for the Sequencer and Arpeggiator in BPM

sync is turned on, the BPM rate affects the LFO frequency. When syncing to 
an external MIDI clock source, the BPM setting has no effect.
Tap Tempo: 30…250— Tap this button at least 4 times to quickly set the 
tempo  for the Sequencer and Arpeggiator. The LED flashes at the BPM 
rate you set.

Dave Smith InstrumentsMaster Volume/Program Volume
The master output level of the Prophet-6 is controlled by the front-panel 
master  vol knob. In addition, the volume of an individual program 
can be set with the prgm  vol knob in the misc parameters  section. This 
is useful for ensuring that your sounds have roughly the same volume 
from program to program. Unison sounds in particular can be very loud compared to other programs.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Distortion
Distortion
The Prophet-6 provides stereo analog distortion. This can be used to 
add warmth, harmonic complexity, and an aggressive edge to sounds. The character of the distortion is affected by the harmonic content of a program. Sounds with more high-end will sound different than sounds with fewer harmonics. To add distortion, use the 
distortion  knob.

Dave Smith InstrumentsHold
When hold  is on, any notes played will continue to play until hold  is 
turned off. When used in conjunction with the Arpeggiator, notes are 
latched on and replaced by any new note(s) struck. If hold  is on and at 
least one key continuously held down, any new notes played are added to the arpeggio.
HOLD
The Hold button
Glide
Glide or portamento causes the pitch of a note to glide up or down from the pitch of the previously played note. Glide is turned on and off using the 
glide  switch, but the glide  amount  must also be set. If the glide  
button is on, but glide  amount  is set to 0, glide  has no effect.
GLIDEGLIDE RATE
The Glide controls
There are four modes that determine how glide  behaves. 
Fixed Rate ( FR):  The time to transition between notes varies with the 
interval between the notes; the greater the interval, the longer the transi -
tion time. The glide rate is fixed. This is the default glide mode.
Fixed Rate A ( FRA): The same as Fixed Rate, but glide is only applied 
when playing legato. That is, glide only occurs when a note is held until 
the next note is played. This effectively allows glide to be turned on and off from the keyboard.


43
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Unison
Fixed Time ( FT): Glide is set to a fixed time, regardless of the interval 
between notes.
Fixed Time A ( FTA): The same as Fixed Time, but glide only occurs 
when playing legato.
To select a glide mode:
1. Press and hold the glide  switch. The numeric display shows the 
currently selected Glide mode. 
2. To select a different mode, continue to hold down the glide  switch then 
press the bank /decrement  and tens/increment  switches to step through 
the other choices.
3. When finished, release the glide  switch.
Unison
When unison  is on, the Prophet-6 functions like a monophonic 
synthesizer in that only 1 note can be played at a time. However, that 
one note can be powered by as many as six voices, depending on how many you choose to use. With up to 12 oscillators powering a single note (2 oscillators per voice x 6 voices), you can create some very dense, speaker-rattling sounds. 
If you want to create an ultra heavy synth bass, try using Unison!
Unison gives you control over not only how many voices to stack, but also the amount of detuning between the oscillators, and what note gets priority if you happen to play more than one note on the keyboard. (This is called the key assign mode or note priority . See “Key Assign Modes” 
on page 45 for details.)
UNISON
The Unison button


44 Unison
Dave Smith InstrumentsTo use Unison:
1. Press and hold the unison  switch. 
2. With the Unison switch held down, use the bank /decrement  and tens/
increment  switches to choose the number of voices to stack, then 
release the Unison switch.
3. To detune the oscillators, use the slop knob.
Using Chord Memory
Unison has another useful feature: chord memory. Instead of assigning 
voices to a single note, hold down a chord on the keyboard and press the Unison switch. The Prophet-6 memorizes the notes of the chord. Single notes played on the keyboard will then trigger all notes of the stored chord, transposing them as you play up or down the keyboard. Try using this feature to create powerful chord stabs and hits. 
If you save a program that uses chord memory, the chord is saved with 
the program. “ CHD” will then appear as a choice if you step through 
voice stacking options using the 
banks /decrement  and tens/increment  
buttons while holding down unison . 
If low-note priority is chosen in Global settings, the note that you play corre -
sponds to the lowest note of the chord voicing. Changing the Key Assign Mode to high-note priority will make the note that you play correspond to the highest note in the chord voicing. 
To use chord memory:
1. Hold down a chord on the keyboard (6 notes maximum).
2. Press the unison  switch. The chord voicing is memorized. Play a few 
notes to listen to the result.
3. If you save the program, the unison chord memory is saved with it.
To clear chord memory:
1. Turn off Unison. 
2. Hold down a single note.
3. Press the unison  button.
4. Save the program again.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Unison
Key Assign Modes 
Key Assign (sometimes called note priority) determines what note has 
priority when more than one note is played on the keyboard or via MIDI:
• Low-note priority ( LO) is most common in vintage synths and is often 
used for playing trills by holding a note and repeatedly tapping a lower note.
• Low retrigger ( LOr) causes the envelopes to be retriggered with each 
keystroke.
•  High note (Hi) and high retrigger ( Hir) are similar to the low note 
settings, except that the highest note is given priority. 
• Last note ( LAS) and last retrigger ( LAr) give priority to the last note 
played.
To choose the Key Assign mode:
1. Press and hold key mode  in the misc parameters  section. The numeric 
display shows the currently selected mode. 
2. To select a different mode, continue to hold down the key mode  switch 
then press the bank /decrement  and tens/increment  switches to step 
through the other choices.
3. Release the key mode  switch when you’re finished.
Key Assign settings are only relevant to Unison mode. They do not affect poly-
phonic playback.


46 Write

The write  button saves the currently active program. Saving a program 
overwrites a previously saved program. 
The Prophet-6 contains a total of 1000 programs. 500 are permanent and 
500 can be overwritten. Banks 0-4 are User Banks that can be overwrit -

To return to preset mode:
• Press the preset  button again to toggle it on. The LED is lit. The 
current program is what you hear.


50 Pitch and Mod Wheels
Dave Smith InstrumentsPitch and Mod Wheels
The Prophet-6 has a spring loaded Pitch wheel and a Mod wheel. You 
can use these controls to enhance live performance by bending notes and adding modulation in real time as you play. 
In the same way that guitar players use note bends and vibrato to give 
their playing expressiveness and character, these two controls can really help you define your sound as a performer and take you beyond just playing notes on the keyboard.  
Pitch Mod
The Pitch and Modulation wheels
Pitch Wheel
You can set a range in semitones for the Pitch wheel, depending on your playing preference. The range is up to 12 semitones (1 octave). Many musicians use a range of 2 semitones (a whole step) since this is the bend range of many acoustic instruments. For guitar whammy bar effects, you many wish to set a wider range.
To set the pitch bend range:
1. In the misc parameters  section, press and hold the p whl range  button.
2. With the button still held down, use the bank /decrement  and tens/
increment  switches to choose the number of semitones (up to 12) for 
the pitch bend range, then release the  p whl range  button. 


51
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Pitch and Mod Wheels
Modulation Wheel
The Mod wheel controls the amount of modulation applied to any destina-
tions chosen in the low-frequency  oscilla tor  section. This allows you to 
“perform” LFO modulation in real time by moving the Mod wheel. This is a great way to add expressiveness to a sound or performance.
To choose a modulation destination for the Mod wheel:
1. In the low-frequency  oscillator  section, choose a modulation desti -
nation as well as a shape  and frequency  for the LFO. (See “Low 
Frequency Oscillators” on page 31 for more details.) 
2. To apply modulation only when using the Mod wheel, set the initial  
amt knob to zero. (Turing this knob up will apply LFO modulation 
continuously — not just when the Mod wheel is used.)
Many programs use the Mod wheel to add vibrato. In this case, Freq 1 and 
Freq 2 are enabled as modulation destinations in the low-frequency  oscillator  
section. This adds vibrato when you push the mod wheel forward. Set the initial  amt 
knob to zero to apply vibrato only when using the Mod wheel.


52 Misc Parameters
Dave Smith InstrumentsMisc Parameters
The misc parameters  section allows you to access controls for a number 
of essential functions described below. To set the key mode  and p whl 
range , hold down the associated button in the misc parameters  section, 
then use the bank /decrement  and ten/increment  buttons to step through 
available settings.
P WHL RANGE KEY MODE
PAN SPREADMISC PARAMETERS
PRGM VOL
The Misc Parameters controls
Pan Spread: Pans the audio in the stereo field individually per voice. Set 
to 0, all voices are panned to the center. As Pan Spread is turned up, the 
audio in each voice is gradually moved away from the center by greater amounts. Every other voice goes in a different direction, left or right. This creates a broader stereo field while playing.
Key Mode: Low Note (LO ), High Note (Hi), Last Note (Las ), Low 
Note Retrigger ( LOr), High Note Retrigger ( Hir), Last Note Retrigger 
(LAr)—Selects the key priority when more than one key is played 
simultaneously in when in Unison mode. low note, high note and last 
note are monophonic playback modes that give priority to the lowest, 
highest, or last note played, as their names imply.
P Wheel Range: 0...12 Semitones—  Selects the range in semitones 
when moving the Pitch Wheel forward or backward. Twelve semitones equals 1 octave.
Program Volume: Sets the volume of an individual program. This is 
useful for matching volume between programs. 
 There is enough gain in the Prophet-6 that if you set some programs to a 
high program  volume , clipping distortion may occur. If this happens, try lowering the 
program  volume , the levels of the oscillators in the mixer, the VCA envelope  amount , or 
the resonance  parameter of the low-pass or high-pass filter.


53
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Aftertouch
Aftertouch
Aftertouch is a performance feature that allows you to add modulation to 
a sound by applying additional pressure to a key after the key is already down. The greater the pressure applied, the more modulation is applied. The Prophet-6 provides monophonic (or “channel”) aftertouch, which 
means that applying pressure to any key within a chord will apply modu -
lation to all notes currently held.
The Aftertouch section lets you choose the amount of modulation applied using aftertouch and which parameters are modulated (oscilla -
tor frequency, filter cutoff, etc.). You can set either a positive or negative amount. 
For example, if you select the Low-Pass Filter as destination (
filter  lp), 
set a positive  amount of aftertouch, then press the keys harder, the filter 
cutoff frequency will increase, making the filter open wider and the 
sound become brighter. 
Conversely, if you select the Low-Pass Filter as destination ( filter  lp), 
set a negative  amount of aftertouch, then press the keys harder, the filter 
cutoff frequency will be lowered, making the filter close more and the 
sound become more muted.  
 The Prophet-6 provides four different aftertouch response settings for your 
convenience. The default setting provides a linear response. To choose a different response curve, use the 
at response  button in the globals  section. See page 14 for 
more details.

Negative amount  settings apply negative amounts of modulation.
Freq 1: Selects Oscillator 1 frequency as an aftertouch modulation desti -
nation. With a positive amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will shift 
the Oscillator 1 pitch upward. With a negative amount  setting, pressing 
the keys harder will shift the Oscillator 1 pitch downward.
Freq 2: Selects Oscillator 2 frequency as an aftertouch modulation desti -

the Oscillator 2 pitch upward. With a negative amount  setting, pressing 
the keys harder will shift the Oscillator 2 pitch downward.
LFO Amount: Selects the lfo amount  parameter as an aftertouch modu -
lation destination. With a positive amount  setting, pressing the keys 
harder will increase the amount of LFO modulation to any destina -
tion selected in the low-frequency  oscillator  section. With a negative 
amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will increase the amount of 
LFO modulation — with the LFO waveform inverted.
Amp: Selects Amplitude as an aftertouch modulation destination. With 
a positive amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will increase the 
volume of a sound. With a negative amount  setting, pressing the keys 
harder will decrease the volume of a sound. 
 If the Amplifier Envelope’s env amount  is set to full, positive amounts of amp 
aftertouch will have no effect since the VCA is already at its maximum output level.
LP Filter: Selects the Low-Pass Filter cutoff frequency as a modulation 
destination. With a positive amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will 
open the filter wider and make a sound become brighter. With a negative 
amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will close the filter more and 
make a sound more muted.


55
Prophet-6 Operation Manual Exporting Programs and Banks
HP Filter: Selects the High-Pass Filter cutoff frequency as a modulation 
destination. With a positive amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will 
increase the high-pass cutoff frequency, reducing the low-end of a sound. 
With a negative amount  setting, pressing the keys harder will decrease 
the high-pass cutoff frequency allowing more low frequencies to pass.
 Controlling the low-pass or high-pass filter frequency with Aftertouch may or 
may not have an audible effect, depending on the cutoff frequency of the filter.
Exporting Programs and Banks
You can use the pgm dump  command in the globals  section  to transmit the 
current program, bank, or all banks in SysEx format via the selected MIDI port. This allows you to save your programs so that you can share them or archive them.
To export a program or bank as a SysEx file over MIDI:
1. Press the globals  button once (this enables the upper set of parameters) 
then press program selector 8 to select the midi sysex  command.  
2. Use the bank /decrement  and tens/increment  buttons to select the 
appropriate MIDI port — MIDI (MID ) or USB (usb ).
3. Press globals  a second time (this enables the lower set of parameters) 
then press program selector 8 to select the pgm dump  command. The 
write  button begins flashing.
4. Use the bank /decrement  and tens/increment  buttons to select the 
desired option — program (PRO), tens (ten ), bank (ban ), user banks 
(USR ), all (all).
5. Press write . The program or bank is exported.
Dumped programs will load back into the same bank and program location in 
memory when received by the Prophet-6 via MIDI. 


56 Calibrating the Prophet-6
Dave Smith InstrumentsCalibrating the Prophet-6
The Prophet-6 is calibrated at the factory. Controls such as the pitch and 
mod wheels shouldn’t require re-calibration. However, because its oscil -
lators and filters are voltage controlled and can be affected by extremes of temperature, you may need to use the built-in calibration function to tune them occasionally.  
How and When to Calibrate the Oscillators and Filters
The first time you use the Prophet-6, please run its built-in oscillator and filter calibration procedure. Let it warm up for several minutes and come to its normal operating temperature before doing so. 
Repeat the calibration procedure as needed over the next few days of 
use. The Prophet-6 learns the range of temperatures at your location and will keep itself in tune over this range. 
Later, if you use the Prophet-6 in a different environment that is measur -
ably warmer or cooler (on stage, in an air-conditioned studio, and so on) 
run the calibration procedure again.
To calibrate the oscillators and filters:
1. Hold down the preset  button and press 0.  
2. The front panel LEDs and display begin flashing as the Prophet-6 performs its auto-calibration procedure. Don’t turn off the power while it’s doing this.
3. When finished, the front panel controls will return to normal and you can play the Prophet-6 again.

Prophet-6 Operation Manual Calibrating the Prophet-6
Calibrating the Pitch and Mod Wheels
In general, the Pitch and Mod wheels shouldn’t require re-calibration. 
However, if you experience what seems like a persistent problem with either of them, the Prophet-6 has built-in auto-calibration procedure that you can use to remedy the problem. 
To calibrate the Pitch and Mod wheel’s low position:
1. Rotate and hold both wheels in their low position.
2. Hold down the preset  button and press 7. 
To calibrate the Pitch wheel’s center position:
• With the Pitch wheel centered, hold down the preset  button and press 8. 
To calibrate the Pitch and Mod wheel’s high position:
1. Rotate and hold both wheels in their high position.
2. Hold down the preset  button and press 9.  
Resetting the Global Parameters
If you’re trying to track down a problem, it’s sometimes a good idea to reset the Global parameters to their defaults. This is a quick way to make sure that the Prophet-6 returns to its factory settings.
To reset all Global parameters to their default settings:
• Hold down the global  button and press write . 


58 Using USB
Dave Smith InstrumentsUsing USB
The Prophet-6’s USB 2.0 port enables bidirectional MIDI communica -
tion with a computer. A MIDI interface and MIDI cables are not neces -
sary, just a USB cable. The Prophet-6 is a Class Compliant USB device. 
That means it does not require any additional drivers to be installed to communicate with a Mac or Windows computer. The Prophet-6 transmits and receives MIDI data via USB, but does not transmit audio.
MIDI In and USB should not be used at the same time, as overlapping 
messages from different sources may cause the Prophet-6 to respond unpredictably. MIDI Out and USB can be used at the same time and transmit the same data.
USB Notes
Under Mac OS X, “Prophet-6 Keyboard” will appear as a MIDI port 
when connected via USB and can be configured using the Mac’s Audio MIDI Setup utility (typically found in Applications/Utilities).
Under Windows, the first time the Prophet-6 is connected via USB, the 
“Found new hardware” alert appears and it is automatically installed as “Prophet-6 Keyboard.”
In Windows, if you unplug the USB cable and plug it back in while a 
program has the Prophet-6 port open, you may have to resync. That 
usually means going to the Prophet-6 Keyboard Properties — in the Windows Device Manager under “Sound, video, and game controllers” — and clicking OK. If Prophet-6 Keyboard is no longer listed in the 
Device Manager, power the Prophet-6 down and back up again while it 
is connected via USB. It should be detected on power up.

Prophet-6  Operation Manual Appendix A: Alternative Tunings
Appendix A: Alternative Tunings
By default, the Prophet-6 is set to standard, chromatic western tuning. 
Additionally it supports up to 16 additional alternative tunings, which you can access using the 
alt tuning  button in the globals  section.   
From the factory, the Prophet-6 ships with 16 preset alternative tunings ranging from Equal temperament to Indonesian Gamelan tunings. If you 
want, you can replace these with other tunings that you can find on the 
Internet. These must be in SysEx format. You can download them into 
the Prophet-6 using SysEx Librarian for Mac or MIDI-OX for Windows.
Here are descriptions of the default alternative tunings:
Nor (Normal) 12 Tone Equal Temperament (non-erasable)
The default Western tuning, based on the twelfth root of two.  
1. Harmonic Series
MIDI notes 36-95 reflect harmonics 2 through 60 based on the funda -
mental of A = 27.5 Hz. The low C on a standard 5 octave keyboard acts 
as the root note (55Hz), and the harmonics play upwards from there. The remaining keys above and below the 5 octave range are filled with the same intervals as Carlos’ Harmonic 12 Tone that follows.
2. Carlos Harmonic Twelve Tone
Wendy Carlos’ twelve note scale based on octave-repeating harmonics. 
A = 1/1 (440 Hz). 1/1 17/16 9/8 19/16 5/4 21/16 11/8 3/2 13/8 27/16 7/4 15/8
3. Meantone Temperament
An early tempered tuning, with better thirds than 12ET. Sounds best in 
the key of C. Use this to add an authentic touch to performances of early Baroque music. C=1/1 (260 Hz)
4. 1/4 Tone Equal Temperament
24 notes per octave, equally spaced 24root2 intervals. Mexican composer 
Julian Carillo used this for custom-built pianos in the early 20th century.


60 Appendix A: Alternative Tunings
Dave Smith Instruments5. 19 Tone Equal Temperament
19 notes per octave (19root2) offering better thirds than 12 ET, a better 
overall compromise if you can figure out the keyboard patterns.
6. 31 Tone Equal Temperament
Many people consider 31root2 to offer the best compromise towards just 
intonation in an equal temperament, but it can get very tricky to keep track of the intervals.
7. Pythagorean C
One of the earliest tuning systems known from history, the Pythagorean 
scale is constructed from an upward series of pure fifths (3/2) transposed down into a single octave. The tuning works well for monophonic melo -
dies against fifth drones, but has a very narrow palate of good chords to choose from. C=1/1 (261.625 Hz)
1/1 256/243 9/8 32/27 81/64 4/3 729/512 3/2 128/81 27/16 16/9 243/128
8. Just Intonation in A with 7-limit Tritone at D#
A rather vanilla 5-limit small interval JI, except for a single 7/5 tritone 
at D#, which offers some nice possibilities for rotating around bluesy sevenths. A=1/1 (440 Hz) 1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 7/5 3/2 8/5 5/3 9/5 15/8
9. 3-5 Lattice in A
A pure 3 and 5-limit tuning which resolves to very symmetrical derived 
relationships between notes. A=1/1 (440 Hz)
1/1 16/15 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 64/45 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8
10. 3-7 Lattice in A
A pure 3 and 7-limit tuning which resolves to very symmetrical derived 
relationships between notes. Some of the intervals are very close 
together, offering several choices for the same nominal chords. A=1/1 
(440 Hz)
1/1 9/8 8/7 7/6 9/7 21/16 4/3 3/2 32/21 12/7 7/4 63/32


61
Prophet-6  Operation Manual Appendix A: Alternative Tunings
11. Other Music 7-Limit Black Keys in C
Created by the group Other Music for their homemade gamelan, this 
offers a wide range of interesting chords and modes. C=1/1 (261.625 Hz)
1/1 15/14 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 7/5 3/2 14/9 5/3 7/4 15/8
12. Dan Schmidt Pelog/Slendro
Created for the Berkeley Gamelan group, this tuning fits an Indonesian-
style heptatonic Pelog on the white keys and pentatonic Slendro on the black keys, with B and Bb acting as 1/1 for their respective modes. Note that some of the notes will have the same frequency. By tuning the 1/1 to 60 Hz, Dan found a creative way to incorporate the inevitable line hum into his scale. Bb, B = 1/1 (60 Hz)
1/1 1/1 9/8 7/6 5/4 4/3 11/8 3/2 3/2 7/4 7/4 15/8
13. Yamaha Just Major C
When Yamaha decided to put preset microtunings into their FM synth 
product line, they selected this and the following tuning as representative just intonations. As such, they became the de-facto introduction to JI for many people. Just Major gives preferential treatment to major thirds on the sharps, and a good fourth relative to the second. C= 1/1 (261.625)
1/1 16/15 9/8 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 5/3 16/9 15/8
14. Yamaha Just Minor C
Similar to Yamaha’s preset Just Major, the Just Minor gives preferential 
treatment to minor thirds on the sharps, and has a good fifth relative to 
the second. C= 1/1 (261.625) 1/1 25/24 10/9 6/5 5/4 4/3 45/32 3/2 8/5 
5/3 16/9 15/8


62 Appendix A: Alternative Tunings
Dave Smith Instruments15. Harry Partch 11-limit 43 Note Just Intonation
One of the pioneers of modern microtonal composition, Partch built 
a unique orchestra with this tuning during the first half of the 20th century, to perform his own compositions. The large number of intervals in this very dense scale offers a full vocabulary of expressive chords and complex key changes. The narrow spacing also allows fixed-pitched instruments like marimbas and organs to perform glissando-like passages. G = 1/1 (392 Hz, MIDI note 67)
1/1 81/80 33/32 21/20 16/15 12/11 11/10 10/9 9/8 8/7 7/6 32/27 6/5 11/9

16. Arabic 12-Tone
A 12-tone approximation of an Arabic scale, which appears in some elec -
tronic keyboards designed for use with Arabic music. Not a JI scale, nor 
equal tempered. These are the intervals in Cents relative to C:
60 = Cents  0.              
61 = Cents +151.          62 = Cents +204.            63 = Cents +294.              64 = Cents +355.              65 = Cents +498.66 = Cents +649.              67 = Cents +702.              68 = Cents +853.            69 = Cents +906.              70 = Cents +996.              71 = Cents +1057.            
72 = Cents +1200

Prophet-6  Operation Manual Appendix B: Troubleshooting and Support
Appendix B: Troubleshooting 
and Support
Troubleshooting
If you’re experiencing problems or unexpected behavior from your Prophet-6, here are a few typical scenarios and their solutions:
The sequencer or arpeggiator has stopped running.  
Check the MIDI Clock setting in the Globals to ensure the Prophet-6 is 
set to 
out or, if set to in or sla ve  thru , make sure the Prophet-6 is receiv -
ing MIDI clock.
Some of the programs sound different than usual.  
Check the Mod Wheel position. The Mod Wheel can do more than just 
add vibrato. Also, check the Clock settings in the Global menu to ensure the Prophet-6 is set to 
out or, if set to in or sla ve  thru , make sure the 
Prophet-6 is receiving MIDI clock.
There is a ground hum in the audio output.  
USB can cause ground loops, so try to resolve any grounding issues between 
the computer and the Prophet-6. Or use MIDI, which is opto-isolated.
The Prophet-6 is behaving erratically. 
This is almost always caused by a MIDI data loop. Make sure that any MIDI Thru functionality is turned off on the MIDI interface/hardware or in the MIDI software application. Disconnect all the Prophet-6’s MIDI connections—MIDI and USB cables—and see if the problem persists. You can also monitor the MIDI traffic with MIDI Monitor (Mac OS) or MIDI-OX (Windows) to see if the Prophet-6 is being overrun with duplicate messages.
The Prophet-6 doesn’t seem to respond to its controls. 
Make sure Local Control is on in the Global settings.
MIDI System Exclusive data is not transmitted/received.  
Make sure that the MIDI SysEx setting in the Global settings is set to 
usb 
or midi depending on which you are using to transmit or receive MIDI 
messages.


64 Appendix B: Troubleshooting and Support
Dave Smith InstrumentsThe Prophet-6 plays out of tune.  
Check Transpose and Master Tune parameters in the Global settings. If 
they seem correct, you may need to retune the oscillators. See “Calibrat -
ing the Prophet-6” on page 56. If this doesn’t help, recalibrate the pitch and mod wheels. “Calibrating the Pitch and Mod Wheels” on page 57.
The pitch or mod wheel doesn’t go go full range. 
Recalibrate the pitch and mod wheels. See “Calibrating the Pitch and Mod Wheels” on page 57.
A filter sounds strange or out of tune. 
You may need to retune the filters. See “Calibrating the Prophet-6” on page 56.
It is not necessary to run any of the calibration routines on a regular basis. You 
should only run it if you are experiencing problems.
If you are still experiencing a problem with the Prophet-6, try resetting the Global parameters. See “Resetting the Global Parameters” on page 57.
Contacting Technical Support
If you are still having a problem with the Prophet-6, contact Technical Support at support@davesmithinstruments.com. Please include your Prophet-6 serial number, the version of the operating system (shown during startup in the main display), and the purchase date.
If you have not already reset the Global parameters and run the calibration 
routines (see Troubleshooting, above), you should do it before contacting Technical Support. It’s probably the first thing they’ll ask you to do.

Prophet-6  Operation Manual Appendix C: MIDI Implementation
Appendix C: MIDI Implementation
The Prophet-6 receives MIDI data according to the settings you have 
chosen in the global  settings. In addition, there is interaction between 
some of the Program parameters that determine the overall response of Prophet-6 to MIDI data. Following are the Global parameters that affect response to MIDI:
MIDI Channel:  All, 1…16— Selects which MIDI channel to send and 
receive data, 1 to 16. All receives on all 16 channels.
MIDI Clock: Sets the Prophet-6’s ability to send and receive MIDI clock 
messages:
•  Off: MIDI Clock is neither sent nor received
•  Out: MIDI Clock is sent, but not received
•  In: MIDI Clock is received, but not sent
• Slave Thru (i-0): MIDI Clock is received and passed to MIDI Out 
• In, No Start/Stop (n55 ): Receives MIDI Clock but does not respond to 
MIDI Start or Stop command.
When set to in or slave  thru , if no MIDI clock is present at the selected input, 
the arpeggiator and sequencer will not function .
Clock Port: MID , USB —Sets the port(s), MIDI or USB, by which MIDI 
clock signals are received.
Param Xmit: Off , CC, NR—Changes to the values of front panel controls 
are transmitted via MIDI as Continuous Controllers (CC) or Non-registered Parameter Number (NR). Transmission of parameters can also be turned off.
NRPNs are the preferred method of parameter transmission, since they cover 
the complete range of all parameters, while CCs are limited to a range of 128.
Param Rcv:  Off, CC, NR—Sets the method by which parameter changes are 
received via MIDI. As with transmission, NRPNs are the preferred method.


66 Appendix C: MIDI Implementation
Dave Smith InstrumentsMIDI Control:  Off, On—When On, the synth will respond to MIDI 
controllers, including Pitch Wheel, Mod Wheel, Pedal, V olume.
MIDI Sysex: MID , USB — When set to MIDI ( MID) it will receive and 
transmit them using the MIDI ports/cables When set to USB it will 
receive and transmit them using the USB port/cable. MIDI SysEx messages are used when sending and receiving a variety of data includ -
ing, programs, alternative tunings, system updates, and more.  
MIDI Out:  MID, USB —Sets the port by which MIDI data will be transmit -
ted (MIDI or USB)..

Dave Smith InstrumentsNRPN Messages
The Non-Registered Parameter Number (NRPN) MIDI messages are 
used to transmit and receive both global and program parameters. They are transmitted when MIDI Parameter Send is set to NRPN in Global, and received when MIDI Parameter Receive is set to NRPN in Global.
The messages are handled in standard MIDI format using the NRPN CC 
commands in running status byte format. Below is the format used for transmitting a NRPN parameter.
Transmitted NRPN Messages
Status Description
1011 nnnn Control Change
0110 0011 NRPN parameter number MSB CC
0vvv vvvv Parameter Number MSB 
0110 0010 NRPN parameter number LSB CC
0vvv vvvv Parameter Number LSB 
0000 0110 NRPN parameter value MSB CC
0vvv vvvv Parameter value MSB 
0010 0110 NRPN parameter value LSB CC
0vvv vvvv Parameter value LSB 
The parameter number can be found in the two tables below, one for 
Global parameters, and the other for Program parameters. The parameter numbers and the parameter values are broken into two 7-bit bytes for MIDI transmission; the LSB has the seven least-significant bits, and the MSB has the seven most-significant bits, though in most cases the MSB will be zero or one, and never more than two.
When receiving an NRPN, all messages do not necessarily need to be 
transmitted, since the synth will track the most recent NRPN number, though it is usually good practice to send the entire message above.
Once an NRPN is selected, the synth will also respond to NRPN Data 
Increment and Decrement commands, which some controllers utilize. Finally, it responds to one RPN (Registered Parameter Number) command, the RPN/NRPN Reset command, which can be handy for resetting the currently selected parameter to a known state.

Prophet-6  Operation Manual Appendix C: MIDI Implementation
Packed Data Format 
Data is packed in 8 byte “packets”, with the MS bit stripped from 7 param-
eter bytes, and packed into an eighth byte, which is sent at the start of the 8 byte packet.
Example:
Input Data    Packed MIDI data1 A7 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0  1   00 G7 F7 E7 D7 C7 B7 A7
2 B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0  2   00 A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0
3 C7 C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1 C0  3   00 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0

     8   00 G6 G5 G4 G3 G2 G1 G0
This explains why it takes 1171 MIDI bytes to transmit 1024 Program data bytes.
